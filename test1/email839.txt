Hello, would anyone know of a source that has kept record of college football games nationally televised over the years?  I am hoping to find data on the teams involved, the time and date of the game, and the network the game was aired on.  I am curious to learn more about the differences in exposure of various top-level programs as college football has become more and more televised over the past couple of decades.
