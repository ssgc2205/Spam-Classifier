Does anyone know of any polls or surveys of public opinion in the African Republic of Chad? I can't seem to find anything at all (I Google, and I checked the Afro Barometer). I can only find on on WorldBank, but it concerns attitudes towards the WB. I want surveys or polls on the public opinion on social issues, values, or political issues.
