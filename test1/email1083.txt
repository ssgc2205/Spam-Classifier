I've written a graphical CSV file viewer and editor for Windows 7/8/10 that lets you view and edit CSV data directly in line plots. I always needed such a tool myself in my job as an engineer working with sensor data files, but I had a hard time finding what I needed, so I ended up writing my own. Now I'm about to release version 1.0 to the public, but before I release it, I'd like to have it tested with as many different data files as possible. Is anyone in here interested in trying it out and providing some feedback?

It's most useful for numeric data files where each column is a variable and each row is a sample, but I've put a lot of effort into making sure that it can load any valid CSV file. It should also be able to load rather large files, but above 1 GB it might become painful, depending on computer specs.

Any feedback - bugs, unexpected behavior, annoying user interface, feature requests and praise - will be greatly appreciated! You can post it here as a comment, use the built-in feedback form in the Help menu and/or write in the user forum.
