About four years ago, I recall finding a US government web site that had comprehensive measurements for thousands of children and adults. I don't remember for sure, but I believe that the data was collected in the 1970s for the purposes of designing helmets, seatbelts, and other safety related items. Does anyone know which data set I'm referring to or a more modern source of similar data? Thanks.
