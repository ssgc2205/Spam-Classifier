Hey all,

I'm working on a textual analysis project, and I would really like to use the dictionary as my corpus. 

An ideal dataset would have:

    word (phonetic spelling) part of speech
    origin
    1. definition 1
    2. definition 2
    ...
    N. definition N
    
    usage

Anyone know where I can get such a dataset?
