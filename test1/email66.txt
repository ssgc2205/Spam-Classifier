I am working on a research project on the effectiveness of the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 and I would like to see if the number of startups and foreign payloads launched by US companies increased after the act was passed into law. If anyone knows where I can find this information or could direct me to where it likely could be found it would be much appreciated.
