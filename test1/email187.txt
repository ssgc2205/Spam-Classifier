Happy Thursday!

We have a growing data science student group that is eager to learn through working on "real life" projects. If you have a project - or part of a project - you would like help on, hit me up about it! 

\*Perhaps you are looking for custom datasets? Model creation? Full project help? Development? Data cleaning? Scripts to do X,Y,Z for your project or idea? You get the idea :)\* 

**The work we do for you will be done without monetary exchang**e. All we ask is that, if agreed upon between You and the student or students, is that the student(s) can use project for their portfolios. Our group includes a wide range of experiences from beginner to those who want to touch up their skills before delving into the data science industry as a professional. We also have a professional data scientist mentoring us to guide and assist us on our journeys.

Our aim is to learn through direct experience while providing You the opportunity to have projects done without financial expense. If you have questions, let me know! If you are a student in DS and interested in participating in the group - let me know!
