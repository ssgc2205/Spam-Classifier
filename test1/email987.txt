We are assigned with a project to grade students examination answers using deep learning. The faculty would upload  key answer and the model needs to be able to grade the students based on the answer similarity. To find the similarity I saw a Quora dataset that had 3 columns. A question1 , question2 and is_duplicate. Which can be used to train a model to find if semantic meaning of both the questions is same or not.Is there a similar dataset for student answers? Thanks.
