Looking for global data in order to analyse optimal locations for wind and solar farms. I've found datasets in GeoTiff format but don't know how to use them.

Perhaps would anyone be able to suggest how to extract underlying data from GeoTiff files (e.g. PV potential values for corresponding lat/long)?
