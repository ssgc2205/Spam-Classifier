Hello frens,  


I made an auto-updating crawler to get all stock and company data available for all companies in the S&amp;P 500 index every day.  


It is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks).

  
Soon I will add some automated reports as well, so that high quality investment information is free and open to anyone.  


Hope it helps,  
Cheers
