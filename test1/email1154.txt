Hi, I hope I'm in the right subreddit, if not I'd be thankful for any advice where to go next :D Sorry if my english is bad, it's not my first language.
I'm currently writing my Masters in Geology and had a bit of a fuck up regarding my data. I lost all of the weather data from the Taza region of Morocco. I don't know how, but now it's gone. The problem is I can't seem to find the data online since I don't know where to look. It was from november 2009 to august 2012 and I got it ages ago from another student who no longer has a copy. 
Now to my question. Where can i find over 10 year old datasets of hourly air temperature and either hourly dew point or relative humidity. 
Thank you in advance for any help I get


Edit: Thank all of you so much for helping me with all of your advices! I'm still figuring some of those websites out and sifting through them but I'm confident that I'll make it and find the data I'm looking for :D 
I never dared to hope to get such a great feedback from you. 
Again, thanks a lot for calming my nerves and ending my midnight panic attack.
