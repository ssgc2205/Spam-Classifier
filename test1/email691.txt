Hi! I'm an aspiring data scientist, just beginning my journey. I'm also vegan and I'm very interested in the relationship between meat consumption and climate change or linked diseases. I'm from Argentina but if the dataset is easy to approach (this would be my first full analysis) it could be worldwide or from a particular country.
