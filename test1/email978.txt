Obviously would love numbers, but I would be enthusiastically grateful for a db of news articles.

Elections are on the horizon, and I really want to try and get at some within and between work on the states.

If anyone has any interest in collaborating on generating an extensive DB of relevant election info in the next month or so (ideally getting as much cross-sectional data as we can....as far back as we can) - shoot me a msg about what kinda data you are interested in/comfortable with/posses/have a line on  - I got some infrastructure we can use for convenience and to try and minimize duplication of work
