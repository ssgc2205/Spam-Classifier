Hello everyone, I am looking for some county level data on *blues musicians*.  I want to map the number of blues musicians by county in Mississippi.  I don't know exactly how to capture this?  I was thinking maybe radio plays, or data on artists signed to major labels?  Also, any county level data on number of poets, writers, painters, etc.  would be really cool.  I don't know if I'm asking for the right thing so any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
