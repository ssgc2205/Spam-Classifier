I would love to see empirical evidence linking the monetary impact of a crime and the cost of the investigation and prosecution. 

one end of the spectrum could be a mass murderer or war lord, the other could be a person who shoplifts - we surely don't devote the same resources for the former and latter. 

data would be interesting
