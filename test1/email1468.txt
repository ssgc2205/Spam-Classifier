Hi Dataset,

I'm working on a start-up with focus on helping small businesses with ad placement for a higher ad-ROI thru big data and smarter ad placement.

So we are looking for company's that gather and/or sell big data on about user behavior on sites like youtube, google search, facebook, twitter, IMDB etc for the purpose of ad placement.

So dose any one know abut any vendors of this type?

Best, 
Jonas
