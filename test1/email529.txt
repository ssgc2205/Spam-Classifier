Hello everyone,

I was hoping someone could assist me in finding an open database of mobile application usage data. Usage data of interest:

- name of app used
- time of day
- duration used
- network throughput (how much data was used in the session)
- possibly model of phone

Doesnâ€™t have to have all these, but if anyone has any sources it would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.
