 1. What are the **multilevel diseases** that **identify** with help of scanning **images**? Such as diseases that identify from MRI, X-ray, CT scans.

As **examples**, I can say Breast cancer, Chronic liver disease.

2. Where can I find the **image dataset** for that disease?

Any ideas and suggestions are much appreciatedðŸ–¤
