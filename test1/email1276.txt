Hey everyone,

I am wondering if anybody might know of a dataset that contains non fatal car accidents incidents for each U.S. states. I know FARs is a good source but all those accidents resulted in a fatality, and I am wanting to do some analysis on non fatal accidents. 


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
