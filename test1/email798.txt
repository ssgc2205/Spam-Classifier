Hi! I'm a high schooler tinkering with neural networks, and I decided to do a project on E. coli infection case prediction for my school's science fair. I was wondering if there was anywhere I could find E. coli cases/incidences per US state, per week/month?

Apologies for the noob question. Up until now most of my projects have just been random things with toy datasets.
