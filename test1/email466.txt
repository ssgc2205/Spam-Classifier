Hi... Looking to put together some data about historical army sizes. Something like the following:

| Year | Babylon | Persia | Mongols | Britain | Rome | USA | ... |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 2000 BC | 2500 | 2000 | 5000 | NA | NA | NA | NA |
| 1950 BC | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 1900 BC | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 2000 AD | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Any links to historical army sizes, already-worked data sets, etc., are all welcome. I'm just looking for a place to find data like this.

Wanted to make something similar to [this](http://imgur.com/a/0OS9B) (simulated data), since [this map](https://i.imgur.com/cDixQse.jpg) is woefully inaccurate *even according to the author*.
