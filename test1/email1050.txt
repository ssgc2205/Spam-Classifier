Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing research (master thesis) on real-time network traffic prediction (using machine learning).

Therefore I need datasets of traffic from central routers/gateways from 2017 through now.

&amp;#x200B;

requirements:

\- at least 1K hosts routed through the host (backbones etc. preferred)

\- frequency 1h our smaller

\- machine-readable (no matter if it's plain text, CSV, MRTG, a database-dump or whatever)

\- data can be completely anonymous (optional background information on the source would be nice)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
