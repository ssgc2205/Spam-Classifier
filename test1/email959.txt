Hi, I would like to find a database on subtitles for tv shows and movies. The information I'd like to see are how many watch this show (with genre), how many with subtitles, do they even offer subtiles, and on what app/channel (e.g Netflix or channel 4 on sky etc).

Information on social media apps are also welcome, would be really interesting to see.

I know there won't be a perfect database for this but anything similar to this sort of thing would be much appreciated.

Most important is if the subtitle is availble and how many people watch it.

Many thanks!
