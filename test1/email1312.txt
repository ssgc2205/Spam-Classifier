Finding an interesting and open image dataset is quite a challenge, especially if you want to use it for creating a workshop, tutorial, or book.

I'm writing a book now, and I didn't want to use the standard cats-vs-dogs dataset, and of course, not MNIST. But I couldn't find a good one.

That's why I decided to create one - a dataset with images of clothes. I've already collected 1000+ images, but I need more

Once I have 10000 images, I'll label them and share under a public domain license (CC0), so anyone can use it for any purpose. 

You can help in many ways:

* Upvote this post to increase visibility 
* Share it with your friends and colleagues
* Take pictures of your clothes and share them
