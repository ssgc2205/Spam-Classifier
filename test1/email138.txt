I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1r76wp/i_downloaded_600000_reddit_comments_over_a_week/) which has 600k comments and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1mbsa2/155m_reddit_comments_over_15_days/) with 15.5m comments. Since they were new, there were very few with score greater than one. Also, they were from all the subreddits those new comments were submitted to.

Anyone know of a good/easy way to get comments (not the newest ones, possibly from a specific sub). I know you can display the page in json format but getting the comments is what I see the tricky bit.
