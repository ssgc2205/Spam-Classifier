Hi redditors!

I am working on a hobby project to detect disease in plant leaves. I have found a pretty reasonable [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset?https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset?) on Kaggle for disease detection on single leaf. However, I wish to first isolate leaf/leaves from a picture not necessarily containing a single leaf (possibly using a technique similar to YOLO) and then run the disease classification algorithm  on each isolated leaf.

I can't find any dataset to train a leaf detector. Every dataset that I've found so far deals with plant diseases classification having images of single leaves. If you guys know any such dataset, please let me know.

cheers
