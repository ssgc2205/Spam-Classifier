I'm doing work with a non profit and doing some analysis on demographics of business owners by location and business size. Does the data set exist somewhere or will I have to pull from multiple sources? Were wanting to create programs that help folks at different levels of business growth.

We are looking for business owners by sex , race, orientation, veteran status, revenue, employee count, and location.

Specifically for Atlanta but the entire Isa would be preferred.
