I am learning R for a statistics course online for school.

was wondering I there are any resources that could help

Cheatsheats for data or something because I do think we only use a subset of R (or something) 

I dont know. I just know Im lost. Already. I think I need a tutor. 

Any leads would be mad appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
