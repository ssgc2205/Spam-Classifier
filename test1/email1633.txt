Does anyone have any idea on finding a dataset involving something like finding a million users on a website and checking their time online every day for a week or so? I need to find a dataset with a million records that can change over multiple time periods. It's something similar to if you were tracking Facebook relationship status for a person over a couple of days, but you do this for a million users. Time cannot be the independent variable for this dataset.
