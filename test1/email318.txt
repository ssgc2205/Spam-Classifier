I'm wanting to make a program to detect the value of playing cards, but I can't find a strong dataset containing images of playing cards. I'm trying to build the dataset myself, but am unsure of what photos to take. I want to make sure it works in lowlight conditions and from different angles, but I don't want to be taking twelve terabytes of photos if I don't have to. What are the most important photos for training this kind of thing?
