I currently work as a mechanic fixing cars. According to fraudguides.com, auto repair complaints make up the largest group of consumer grievances. While I certainly don't condone fraud in any way, I do see it happen from time to time. I would argue that this is a cause of how these auto repair salesman are paid. Commission based pay encourages these people to sell things if a customer needs them or not. I wonder if this hypothesis of mine would hold true for all job positions where employees are paid on a commission.
