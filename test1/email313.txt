Hey all!

I'm doing research this summer and I need help finding some data. I need the most current data possible on average measurements for American females, aged ~18-30. I found [this data](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm) but it seems a bit out of data, and I was hoping someone could find something a bit more recent. 

The parameters I am looking for include:
* Height
* Weight
* Bust
* Waist
* Inseam

Obviously I don't need all of these, but as many as possible would be lovely. I feel like this data should be easier to find, but I am having trouble. Can anyone give me a suggestion where to look, or find some current data for me?

Thanks ahead of time!
