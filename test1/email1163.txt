Hey guys, just found your sub, thought I'd give this a shot. For one of my labs in my stats class I can choose any dataset I want to analyze using a program called R. I was wondering if you guys had any cool datasets for weird phenomena? I was given datasets in my class but they're really bland and boring. I want something funny to talk about! Thanks for all your help :)
