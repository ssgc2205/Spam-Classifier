Having a portal where people enter in financial information and then gets zapped to a place where the numbers team can evaluate them would be great. But I am also trying to reduce redundancy as well. If a person types in information for project ABC and it already exists... I would like it to pull up the previously entered data for that project, and then they can update whatever values they previously entered for that project, instead of just creating a new entry/dataset for project ABC
