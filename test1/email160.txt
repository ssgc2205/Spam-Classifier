I’d like to have a download link to the CVUSA dataset used in this paper `Sixing Hu, Mengdan Feng, Rang M. H. Nguyen, Gim Hee Lee. CVM-Net: Cross-View Matching Network for Image-Based Ground-to-Aerial Geo-Localization. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2018.`

I’m trying to reproduce and test the deep learning model in the repository corresponding to this paper ([david-husx/crossview\_localisation (github.com)](https://github.com/david-husx/crossview_localisation)), but I can’t use the current one due to missing “splits” directory, I tried googling for the dataset, I found this website [Crossview USA (CVUSA) (uky.edu)](http://mvrl.cs.uky.edu/datasets/cvusa/), but there are multiple dead links, specifically the subset used for localization evaluation.
