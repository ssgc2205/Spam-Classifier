Hello all,

I have a week off and wanted to do a quick RPA project, mostly for the COVID-19 pandemic, but can be for anything. If anyone needs a specific dataset that needs to be scraped, gathered, or organized in some fashion, comment it below!

&amp;#x200B;

**Update:** So I did some research today and concluded that I will attempt to do 2 of the most requested datasets this week, time permitting and prioritized as follows.

1. Coronavirus daily cases count per country, updated daily. Might upload to a GitHub for it unless we have another suggestion for that.
2. Instead a strict data set for someone yawning for example, Im going to be looking into building a solution that can easily mine data of whatever type of picture using google images. While this may lead to some junk in the data, I believe the dynamic / generic value of the bot will be greater. I can distribute a how-to-guide on using the bot, and ways to improve the data it mines. If anyone has any other suggestions, please feel free to comment.

If either of these fall through, I will be working on a dataset for the environmental or social factors to compare the impacts of covid. Thanks for all of the awesome ideas! I will look to post the links here.

Also thanks for the award!

**Update 2:** I have mostly been working on the generic solution to data mining desired pictures, however I also created this repo with the initial upload of COVID-19 cases. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. I will be working on a way to collect older daily data, though I plan on updating this every night at 9PM EST, which will represent that current day's case count.

That can be found here:  [https://github.com/Ryzen120/COVID-19\_Daily\_Cases](https://github.com/Ryzen120/COVID-19_Daily_Cases)

**Update 3:** Discontinuing my daily case project, as I found this.

I am still continuing on the picture mining bot.
