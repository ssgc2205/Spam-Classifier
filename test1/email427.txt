I'm looking for data that lists (ideally by country or lifestyle) the energy consumption of the average person broken down by end-use. Bonus points for CO2 footprint or climate impact.

I'm looking specifically for a data set that includes end-uses like 

* residential heating    
* household electricity 
* transportation
* food production
* production of consumer goods

I'm hoping for quantitative answers to questions like "how much kWh does a vegetarian diet save?" and "does household electricity usage even matter compared to commuting by car?"

Thanks!
