Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to determine the floral composition of honey using machine learning for a little side project.

I am looking for a reasonably sized dataset of pollen grains. 

I have found the \[[POLEN23E](https://figshare.com/articles/POLEN23E/1525086)\]( [https://figshare.com/articles/POLEN23E/1525086](https://figshare.com/articles/POLEN23E/1525086)) dataset, but it is quite small.

Does anyone have an idea if there is a bigger pollen grain dataset out there?

cheers
