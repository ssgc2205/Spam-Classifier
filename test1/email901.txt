Hello,

I am looking for ways to collect news article corpus of specific media like CNN or Fox that also has a time range. 

For instance:

corpus of all CNN articles published in 2012, corpus of all FOX articles published in 2012, etc. 

How do I approach getting this data? Do I need to scrape them myself?
