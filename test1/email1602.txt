For a university project I am looking for a dataset or other resource that has a list of URLs of articles about false health news.

This can be anything from false health advice, ie, "rub dog food on your face for the perfect complexion" to the more serious "drink salt water to prevent ebola."

I need as many fake articles as I can get, and if possible, the refutations of the fake articles as well. 

Many thanks if a resource like this is available. If not I'll be sure to post what I put together by the end of my project.
