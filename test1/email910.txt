so in this image as u can see a website screen shot in fed in and it is normalized, color coded i suppose and than according to those colors custom hand drawn images are imposed unto them and somewhat converted into hand drawn mockup which I want to achieve.

what i wanna ask is what should be correct approach to do this, what frameworks or libraries i should use. if someone can suggest python packages that would be huge help but others languages are also fine.I have to create a huge dataset with thousand of websites screenshots which will go under this process.
