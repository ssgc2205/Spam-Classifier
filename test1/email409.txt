Hi guys! I am a student at Swarthmore College, currently conducting a study on people's policy positions. The study is intended for a class project, and will not be published in a journal or anything similar. It would really help us out a lot if you could donate a bit of your time (15-20 minutes, depending on how detailed you want to be) - and you can choose to be entered into a raffle to win a $10 Amazon gift card!

After the project is finished, I'll share any findings with you all to ensure transparency and so that you guys can see the outcome of the study you took part in.

Please DM me about any questions and concerns.

Thank you for your time!
