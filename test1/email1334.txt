I hope this post is appropriate here!

So far I have done 12 gigs, and I have no plans to stop. During edinburgh festival my goal is to do at least 30 gigs, by the end of the year i should have done at least 60. For a few gigs now I have been writing myself a little "post gig" note to remind myself of how it went. After my 12th gig today I had the idea to start collecting some hard data. I think once I've done a large number of gigs (like over 100) there should be some interesting trends and things to look at.        
      
Here are the things I am planning to log so far (and have entered for the gigs I've done already, where I can remember)

Date        
Gig Name       
Venue Name    
Area   
Day of Week     
MC Name         
Number of acts       
Number of female acts (incl me &amp; mc &amp; headliner if appropriate)     
Number of audience members (if under 10 this is exact, over 10 is an approx)         
Number of female audience members (if under 10 this is exact, over 10 is an approx)          
Number of people I brought         
Who, if any, was the named headliner?    
Start time (of whole evening)      
End time (of whole evening)           
Time arrived home            
Minutes Performed           
Jokes totally fluffed         
Intended bits accidentally omitted      
Number of heckles (so far always zero!)  
Score I'd give myself out of 10 where: 10 = Absolute comedy genius &amp; 0 = Dying on arse           
Score I'd give myself out of 10 where: 10 = Best I've done so far &amp; 0 = Worst I've done so far          
Score I'd give myself out of 10 where: 10 = Best of the acts present &amp; 0 = Worst of the acts present          
Out of 10: Nerves in hour beforehand           

Things I am considering logging that will require a lot more effort (listening back to the audio and counting):             
Number of jokes/moments I hoped for laughs        
Number of laughs (any kind)         
Number of small laughs         
Number of medium laughs         
Number of huge laughs          
Number of mid set applauses            


Any ideas for what else I should or could be logging?
