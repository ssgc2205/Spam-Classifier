I have a large dataset (website scrape) with around 200k files and ~400mb compressed. I try to move it around my local network with ZIP or 7z but it's very slow to compress, decompress, and work with it.

Is there any secret sauce to make it more snappy with this datasets or I just have to suck it up?

Edit: Forget the "Â¿", although it's a giveaway of what's my primary language.
