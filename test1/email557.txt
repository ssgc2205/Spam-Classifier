I am a Research and Development intern at University of Colombo School of Computing in Sri Lanka.  I am currently working on a credit card fraud detection research.

But I couldn't find a suitable dataset to work on. I am currently using the credit card fraud detection dataset which can be found in Kaggle.

But I need a real-time dataset with known features so that I can work on the data properly.

his is the work I have done so far with the credit card transaction dataset.

I used Autoencoders for the model building and H2O as the ML platform in python.

Feel free to comment on the model. :)
