I was wondering if anyone was aware if there was a dataset containing the results of government elections at the county level?

 I've found Ballotpedia, but it seems like they only cover the local elections for the top 100 cities in the U.S., and I was hoping to get election results for all counties if possible. If no such dataset already exists, any tips on how one may try to create it? Thanks!
