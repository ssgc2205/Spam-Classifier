I want to analyse drivers behaviour, specially, to cluster drivers according to their "driving style". 

Data I expect is acceleration, breaking, temperatures, fuel consumption, speed, torque, inclination etc.

I tried [geotab](https://data.geotab.com/our-data) data, but I can't sign up to have access to their google big query.

There is the [kaggle data](https://www.kaggle.com/yunlevin/levin-vehicle-telematics), but it is not diverse enought.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone help?
