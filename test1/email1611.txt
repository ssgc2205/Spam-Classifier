Hi!

My name is Nayrovi Mercedes. I am a graduate student at Pace University, conducting a research study on The Impact of Attachment Styles on Well-Being, Perception of the Learning Environment Adjustment, and Academic Performance in College Students. It would be great if you can spare a few minutes of your time to participate in this survey, it would be greatly valued​. PLEASE HELP ME; I NEED 35 MORE PARTICIPANTS TO REACH MY GOAL
