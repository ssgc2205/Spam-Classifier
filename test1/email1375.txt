[Here](https://mega.co.nz/#!SYJzHBzR!f2IB0ArpMPzr3PidWXNajvjzAhfirD9uWhHsMpGtxQQ) are 626 presidential speech transcripts from the Miller Center (every speech shown on [this](http://millercenter.org/president/speeches) page).  The file is a 5.8MB zip with each speech as a separate txt file.  Presidential debates are included and there are speeches all the way back to George Washington.  I just crawled the site to get these and thought I would share.  I'd love to hear of anything that gets done with them! :)
