Hi everyone. I'm involved in a problem on Kaggle.

This is my dataset https://www.kaggle.com/minhhuy2810/rice-diseases-image-dataset

As you can see, nothing is displayed in the data source tab.

But when I click download, the downloading process still started.

In short, I cannot download my dataset separately by version. Do you guys have any solution?

Thank you!
