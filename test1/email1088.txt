Hi Reddit Users, 

I'm a graduate student working on my master's thesis in Educational Evaluations and Research. My topic for my master's thesis will evaluate how well state standardized tests for special populations (students with disabilities) measure intended proficiency targets.

The state that I live in makes it really hard for students to get access to any kind of department of education data. So I decided to put a blast out to the reddit community to see what states provide non-aggregated standardized test data (specifically item level responses to each question) on their website. Or even states that make it fairly easy for students to obtain their standardized test data.

If anyone has any advice that could steer me in the right direction, I would be forever grateful!
