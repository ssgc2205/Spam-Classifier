Hey guys, i want to collect data through an API but i cant find them online if any can help or point me in the right direction to look for them.

I need two API's:
1- data on available transportation on each country containing mode of transport, locations and fare price.
2- data on COVID19 restrictions in countries containing the restrictions on travel mainly. For example in turkey there is a restriction that the country locksdown after 10 pm.
