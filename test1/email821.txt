I know the question sounds stupid and I need to be more specific but I need a classifier(binary) for tweets based on its "relatedness" to money. Few of the possible ways I have thought: 
1. Get the twitter data from multiple money related hashtags.
2. Parsing wiki for the terms and getting the corpus, followed by extracting nouns and verbs. What would be the easiest way to do this? 

Any direction is much appreciated for extracting the data I am looking for.
