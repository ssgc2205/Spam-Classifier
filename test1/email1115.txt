Hi my name is Sarah Wasley and I am a Florida student involved in the research program at my high school currently conducting a research survey regarding the correlation between mental health and career aspirations/education goals of young adults. I am here asking for survey respondents between the ages of 16 and 22. The survey is a short eleven questions inquiring as to your personal and family history of mental illness as well as your future goals, and completely anonymous. There are zero personal identification questions, and your privacy is protected by my institutional review ethics board. This is a completely independent study, and the data gathered will be evaluated against existing data regarding the mental health and suicide rates of established professionals within creative and artistic fields. I ask that anybody who is willing participates, it would be a great help in contributing to the broader field of knowledge regarding the impact of specific professional fields on mental health and vice versa. Thank you.
