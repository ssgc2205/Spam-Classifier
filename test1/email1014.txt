I am doing a report on global health, and some of the WHO datasets are very relevant to my report. However, they have such limited years! [T](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.182?lang=en)[he dataset on infant mortality rates only includes years from 2013 on.](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.182?lang=en) I have tried filtering the years, and it only gives me the option to exclude some years from 2013-2018. And they definitely have data from further back than 2013. [Their page on infant mortality rate has a graph with data from the 1990s.](https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/neonatal_infant/en/) I'm new to this, so I don't know if I'm missing something obvious, but I can't find any of the older data. Any advice?
