Hi

As the title says, monthly interest rates on loans of european banks. I have access to multiple high-end databases through uni but can't seem to find any data. I'd be happy with the rates on any kind of loan, I can work with whatever I get however I'd prefer mortgages or consumers credit. If possible data starting in 2007 or earlier. If you need any more information, please do comment.

Thanks in advance
