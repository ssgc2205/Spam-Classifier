Some people say I'm crazy. Sometimes they are right.

# My goal is to catalog, parse, and analyze the properties of misinformation campaigns on the internet.

It is very difficult to address a problem if you don't understand the full scope of the issue. I think most people are aware that there is a lot of misinformation out there, but they think that its relegated to the crypts of the internet and they are not effected by it.

It's not. It's EVERYWHERE. And you've touched it.

I don't think blind censorship is the solution. It is a quick fix that just creates a temporary inconvenience, as Parler has showed us, and does nothing to stop the actual campaigns.

I won't lie to you and say *I* have the answer right now. I don't. But I do know where to start, and that's with some good questions:

* How many platforms are actually hosting and distributing this content?
* What channels are utilized to reach users? How is the content found by users?
* How much of the content is organic vs manufactured?
* How many people does this content reach per day?

The answers will shock you! You may literally be electrocuted.

I am doing this manually at the moment to get a rough picture of the situation, and could use your help! I need to itemize things like subreddits, facebook groups, twitter tags, news sites, etc, which serve to aggregate and disseminate misinformation content.

Once I analyze enough content, I can make tools to find and scrape more content like it, and catalog the results.
