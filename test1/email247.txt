I have seen various movies and series character screen time. Like - GOT, Avengers, etc.

How exactly do they create such dataset. 

Does someone sit with a stopwatch for each character ?

Or maybe create a character recognition deep learning model and  run over each episode or movie?

Like HOW ?

If you know then let me know . If you know someone who did this, then how did they do it?
