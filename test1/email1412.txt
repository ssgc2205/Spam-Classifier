Hello fellow Redditers!

I am a comp sci student and I'm looking for a dataset involving movie data that has information for the movie title, a ratings scale, and comments relating to the movie. The Netflix dataset has the first two, but doesn't have any comments associated.

I found the netflix prize dataset, a flixster dataset, and a MovieLens dataset which all have titles and ratings. Now I need comments. 

Any ideas? =)

Thanks!
