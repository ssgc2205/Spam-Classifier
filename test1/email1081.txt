Hi people \~ I'm doing a research about the effects of covid on Brazilian IT companies, and I need a dataset on IT companies due the pandemic. Something like [https://pt.teamlyzer.com/covid19](https://pt.teamlyzer.com/covid19) or [https://layoffs.fyi/](https://layoffs.fyi/) with some brazilian data in it. Can be about negative or positive effects. It's been a hard time looking for it, so please just let me know if anyone has any idea.  Thanks!
