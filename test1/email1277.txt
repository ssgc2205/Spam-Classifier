I'm looking for "garbage" datasets that are available on the internet, where the data is completely worthless or even a liability to have around (whether for legal reasons or because it's insidiously misleading).  Having made a data or two myself, I know these must exist, like whole experiments where the calibration was off and the result is terabytes of basically noise.  Does anyone know of any datasets like this in the wild?
