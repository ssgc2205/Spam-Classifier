I scraped these about a year ago, with the intention of training some generative neural networks on them. I never ended up finishing that project, but I thought other people might have some use for the data.

I made a little [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/unusual-favicons-a-brief-survey) that shows some examples from the dataset, with an emphasis on exploring examples that are unusual in various ways.

Because they're naturally tiny images, (16x16 is the most common size), my hope is that they might be useful as an MNIST-like dataset that can be used to play with deep learning models without prohibitive hardware/time requirements.
