Using the list of counties from the Census bureau, I would like to fill in the blanks with longitude, and latitude values with each county for a project I'm working on. I'm new to the API stuff.

Data here from the census bureau.

[https://api.census.gov/data/2019/pep/population?get=NAME,POP,DENSITY&amp;for=county](https://api.census.gov/data/2019/pep/population?get=NAME,POP,DENSITY&amp;for=county)

Data for the US for 3142 counties..

Does this exist anywhere?
