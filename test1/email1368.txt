Hello Reddit,

I am looking for a data set consisting of a detailed description of each accident in a given country and time period with respect to the main relevant variables (fatalities, seatbelt/no seatbelt, speed, type of crash, etc). This would be used in a 15-page project for undergraduate econometrics.

Any country/state will do, and any time period will do. The most important thing is that the data set is occurrence by occurrence and details the main variables.

Thank you in advance!
