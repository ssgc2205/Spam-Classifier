Hi All

I'm looking for television ratings data for major US sports (basketball, baseball, hockey, football, soccer, tennis, motorsport etc), for the years 1980, 2000 and 2015.

I'm trying to find data for the sport as a whole not just a single event (eg, U.S. Open (tennis) or NBA finals (basketball).

I'm focusing on Audience size or Neilsen rating but anything comparable will do!

Thanks a lot
