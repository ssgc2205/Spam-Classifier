Hi there, 

I am a BI developer intern, I just finished database fundamentals course and my supervisor engineer asked me and my team to find a database where I can perform what I learned including: 


- Entity Relationship Diagram 
- Mapping from ERD to Schema 
- Normalization 
- Import it in SQL Server Management Studio and do some basic DML and DQL 
- Use it in the Graduation Project at the end of the Course. 


We’ve been browsing datasets on kaggle but most are a table or hardly two where we can’t find relations or even normalize properly. 

Kindly suggest me databases or share your opinions. 

Thanks in advance.
