Im new to this machine learning and dataset stuff, so please bear with me haha. I want to filter out the color responses from the [Moodo Dataset](http://mood.musiclab.si/index.php/en/dataset) 

The public dataset includes 200 audio clips and 37 responses per clip and I only need the color responses per audio clip. Is there any way I can filter out the .xml file and get the audio and color response only?
example:
audio #1 : [ color responses ]
audio #2 : [ color responses ]
