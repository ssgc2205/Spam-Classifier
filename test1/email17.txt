Hello!I didn't know where else to turn to, so here I am.I have a large dataset (I guess around 2,5-3m rows in excel and around 70 columns, 1,1GB) that I need to work with.The dataset is from 2000 - 2017, and row nr 1m is 2006, if that helps to visualize (Classified dataset, can't upload or show).I need to extract 3 rows and run them through a formula. The formula is like X/(Y-Z).

So, how can I solve this?I need to be able to see the whole dataset (need to sort it later on, but if I get help with the formula mentioned, the rest should be easy).If clarification is needed I'll answer questions ASAP.

Please don't bash me, I'm new to working with datasets of this size.  


EDIT:  
I used RStudio (with dplyr) and some help from some truly amazing guys.
