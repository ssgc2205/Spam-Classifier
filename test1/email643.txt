Hey guys, 


I'm wondering how do we identify whether the dataset will be suitable practice the methods of regression ? 


Mainly these 3 methods of regression on particular : 

Least square, logistic and regularized regression 


What are the criteria that I have to consider before choosing a dataset to work on? 


p.s. feel free to share the source of the dataset or maybe a link from Kaggle :)

Appreciate it!
