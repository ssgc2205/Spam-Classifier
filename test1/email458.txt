Hi all, 

I am looking for a Covid-19 dataset that contains the current/future planned state of zip codes (in lock-down, open phase 1 or phase 2.., opening as of x date) in North American (US and/or Canada). 

I know there are a lot of sources for Covid cases, deaths and timelines which is great  :)

Any direction is appreciated, cheers,
