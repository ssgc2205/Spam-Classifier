Hello, i'm a computer science major in a data visualization class and I am struggling to get a data set for my final project. My interest is in running and the new Nike  Vaporfly shoes. I found an application called Strava and it has soooo much data including self reported shoe data, but I can't figure out how to get other people's data. I know that it is possible because there was a article in the New York Times where they had that information. I know its a long shot, but maybe somebody has an idea of how to accomplish this. Even if someone has a dataset that can accomplish something similar would be amazing.

Here is the New York Times article if anyone is interested.  [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/13/upshot/nike-vaporfly-next-percent-shoe-estimates.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/13/upshot/nike-vaporfly-next-percent-shoe-estimates.html)
