I am interested to see the divide between the students that prefer the synchronous and asynchronous learning model, since colleges/universities/highschool have adapted these models due to COVID-19.

I am also interested to see if there is a data set that explores the part-time and full-time students' perspectives of working while asynchronous learning, learning while putting work on hold, or working while putting learning on hold during the pandemic.

This would be greatly appreciated if someone out is able to help me out. if it helps i am located in Canada, so if there is any Canadian data sets that would be great, but it does not need to be Canadian focused.

Thank you in advance!
