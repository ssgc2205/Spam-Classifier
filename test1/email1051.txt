From a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/knight-commission-unveils-new-college-sports-financial-database-300808816.html):

In an effort to inject more financial transparency into college sports, the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics has unveiled a revamped and innovative [College Athletics Financial Information (CAFI) Database](http://cafidatabase.knightcommission.org/). The new resource provides unprecedented access to athletics revenues, expenses, and debt as well as institution-wide academic spending for more than 220 public NCAA Division I colleges and universities dating back to 2005.

The free, open-access database provides telling documentation of major college sports finances, at a time when institutions face lawsuits to direct more financial benefits to student-athletes. For the first time, database users are able to view rich graphics that demonstrate, by institution, conference or competitive subdivision, "Where the Money Comes From" and "Where the Money Goes" in college sports.
