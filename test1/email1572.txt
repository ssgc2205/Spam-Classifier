There used to be the "People's Republic of Tinder" dataset hosted on Kaggle. It was essentially a collection of scraped Tinder images of men and women. However, the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/chrisroths/peoples-republic-of-tinder-1) yields 404 now. I'd like to play with the dataset and try to build a recommender system. It's only for research and private purposes, nothing commercial. Does someone still have the dataset somewhere?
