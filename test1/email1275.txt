I'm currently writing an exam paper about the different policy outputs in relation to abortion laws in New Mexico and Louisiana. I need data on the publics view on abortion in these two states from 2019, but i can only find data from 2014. Can you help me? I have a hard time navigating between different American polls and research papers from the States here in Denmark :)
