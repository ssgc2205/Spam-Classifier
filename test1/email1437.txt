Hi,

I currently work on map structure prediction so given a partial observation of the map i search to predict the structure of some region a didn't observe yet. To do so i need a dataset of map/floorplan/structured maze in order to build my dataset but all the floorplan/maze i found are not structured \(generated randomly which is useless for my research\) or their are available only in pdf which is not the best format for extracting coordinates of walls.

Ideally, i would like to find structured maps that could be represented as a matrix of 0s and 1s \(empty = 0, wall = 1\) but its very important for those map to be structured, to describe a structured scene that we could see in the real world

Thanks you !
