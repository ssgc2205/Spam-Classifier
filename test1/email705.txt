Hey folks, I already asked this in the /r/sna and /r/datascience subreddits, but I couln't find help there. 
I'm an undergrad student and I'm about to write my thesis, but I need help finding data that fits. The idea is to observe the evolution of communities in Affiliation Networks. To observe the evolution I need a network with timestamps on the edges. I googled a lot and couldn't really find an affiliation network with timestamps such as here: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/ or http://www.barabasilab.com/rs-netdb.php. Does anybody here know other sources that might be worth looking at? I found several bipartite graphs with timestamps, such as for when a user listens to a song from a musician. My idea was, if can't find anything, to create out of this data an affiliation network of a user that likes at time t=0 the band XY and observe how/if this changes until t=1. The assumption is basically that a user isn't into a band anymore if they didn't listen to it in the next interval. In general this model is far from reality I guess, but it's a start. I could group the data in the musician model by genre and investigate whether there is a pattern to if/how the users change there music preferences. Such that: If a new musician/band appears, does the user still listen to songs they were before, to the exclusion of the new music, or do they keep track with what is popular/new at the moment? 
**TL;DR** Need Affiliation Network with timestamps on each edge for thesis
