Hi Guys,
How is it going?

I've made made available a dataset containing the ratings of netflix shows. 

The dataset was originally collected by [Chase Willden](https://data.world/chasewillden) and you can see the original version on the author's profile on data.world.
All credit for making the dataset go there!  

Check it out [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/netflix-showse).

Have Fun!
