Hi, I'm looking for a dataset of human responses to multiple-choice questions. For example, the scantron data from a standardized test. Any topic would be valuable, but I am particularly interested in general knowledge, math, and science. The dataset would also need to include the text of each question and possible response. Just to be clear, I need to know how each person responded to each question, not just scores. Thanks for your help!!
