Greetings,

&amp;#x200B;

I am attempting to write an undergraduate econometrics paper but could REALLY use some help. In order to do so (based on my topic) I am searching for a dataset containing the following information (with at least 200 data points):

&amp;#x200B;

* Total life insurance coverage
* Income
* Home Value
* Geographic region (preferable at least three regions within the US)
* Number of kids
* Age
* Level of education

If it has most but not all of these, that will be okay as well. But I for sure want to have it include the total amount of life insurance, and income of the policy holder
