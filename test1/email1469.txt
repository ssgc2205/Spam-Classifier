Hey all,

I am looking to see if anyone has already compiled a list of magic the gathering decks, preferably in the MTGO format. I've seen plenty of places online to download the decks one at a time but no dumps of decks from what I can find. If anyone knows where I can find such a beast without having to scrape it from some sites that would be awesome!

Thanks for the help.
