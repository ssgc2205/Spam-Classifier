Hi, I'm really interested in the economic impacts that the legalization of marijuana could have on US states that have yet to fully legalize. I think I'm going to need a few different datasets to fully research this topic. I'm interested in anything from arrests (misdemeanors or felonies) related to marijuana to the number of estimated users per state/country wide, I understand this data might be hard to come by as most of this will be self-reported. 

I'm also interested in attempting to project tax-revenue that could be generated as well as what industries would hurt/benefit from legalization; I'm assuming most of this data might come from Colorado if it is reported at all. Datasets on alcohol/tobacco tax could help as well. 

Really any kind of datasets you guys could throw my way would help as the datasets I have currently aren't very detailed. Any information or datasets on CBD and CBD clinical trials would also help. Thanks to anybody who hits me with a link, I know I'm asking for a lot.
