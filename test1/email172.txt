I'm a post graduate student in Data Science. I'm working on the topic "Flood Prediction" for my capstone project.   
Hard time finding the right dataset and deciding as well, as to what type of dataset should i go for? Should it be image one or the normal dataframe one?  
Also should i do it on a global level or chose a specific country or region?  
Have to complete the capstone project by the end of this year! Suggestion needed accordingly and much appreciated  
thank you
