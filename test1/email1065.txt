I am looking for a global data set that gives me more granularity than countries. I understand things will be set up and named differently across the world, but still hoping for something as standard as it can be so I can for any individual country drill down to its regions, districts, provinces, departments, etc.
If there are multiple levels to drill down to that would be fabulous. 
Anyone that can point me to such dataset, please?
