**Context:**

Dataset from an attempt to teach computers to write silly poems, given a prompt / topic. 

I wrote a (surprisingly elaborate / painful) script to post each day's top news stories to Mechanical Turk, asking turkers to summarize each article as a haiku. I verified the syllable counts for each haiku against a syllable dictionary and/or manually (for unrecognized words).

It's been running since March. About \~2,000 people have responded and there are now \~2,700 haikus, forever memorializing the worst year of our lives, as punchy/gloomy sets of 5, 7, 5 syllables.

**Semi-plausible use cases:**

* Data art
* Language models
* Translation (with unusual constraints)
* Summarization
