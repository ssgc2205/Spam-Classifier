How many U.S. universities provide courses that explicitly lecture on niche STEM topics (e.g. 'synthetic biology')? I am curious how accessible these new subfield are for undergraduate students, and if formalization of these subjects (i.e. fully-devoted seminars on the topic) display regional or socioeconomic clustering. Thanks for any info!
