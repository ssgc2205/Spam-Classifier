For a university project I am currently searching for companies, preferably european ones, that wholly implemented the guidelines laid on in the GRI 207. Unfortunately data banks like Orbis or Dafne havent given me the results I need, since I need to find out which companies I actually need to be looking at. Are there any data banks that have consolidated all companies that report according the GRI 207, especially in regards to tax transparency and country-by-country reporting like Vodafone or Tesco do?
