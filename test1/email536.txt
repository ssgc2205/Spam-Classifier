Hey everybody,

I hope this is the right sub -- I'm trying to rank startups in my field (and my city) based on how much support they're gaining, how much money they're making, and whatever other criteria might be relevant. What are some good places to look for this kind of data? Things like social media following &amp; the number of articles written about the startup recently are probably relevant, but I can't think of what other data would be publicly available...

Thanks!
