I work in healthcare research and look after a nationwide database containing project level data on clinical trials (where study running/ type of study/important dates/recruitment etc). 

I currently extract the raw data into excel, tidy it up, write vlookups, if statements, pivot tables. 

Looking for a better way forward in analysing this data for reporting. 

I've no sql experience or any other programming language. 

Any recommendations on software to learn to make an analysis quicker and generate tables/graphs?
