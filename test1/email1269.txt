Are there any publicly available datasets of deepfake images and videos, possibly of a large and varied distribution of faces. The few datasets i found on kaggle were too narrow, in the sense that they would be unable to encompass the whole length and breadth of human faces on the planet.
My team is looking for a mid sized dataset. At least containing some 30k images.
Any clues?
