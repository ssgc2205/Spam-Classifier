Hello. I previously have found a site that sells spatial data. Package costs around $100, but I forgot the website and cant find it anymore (even in my browsing history).

I hope you could help me find it. Here's a description on what I can recall:

\-They sell spatial data (includes airways, buildings, households)

\-They sell each data based on country and category. You may check the checkboxes of your choice.

Example: i want household and buildings in Iceland, so I will pick Iceland then check only household and buildings checkboxes, and the price will update accordingly.

\-They provide sample data ( I got sample data from a region in Iceland, I just cant find the file anymore)

I hope somebody could help me find the website. Been searching for hours, and I really need it.

If I really cannot find it, perhaps other cheap source of somewhat reliable dataset would definitely help.

Thank you in advance. :)
