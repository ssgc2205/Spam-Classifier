I've made a [github repo](https://github.com/SampleDataForChange/wapo-data-police-shootings) to ingest the Washington Post's [data-police-shootings](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings) csv data and publish it weekly as a documented and normalized (third normal form) SQL Server &amp; SQLite database.

CSVs are great for basic use, but my hope is to make the data easier to use for demos, examples, and of course analysis as well! I think the world would benefit from data like this being more readily attainable, so that is part of the larger project [Sample Data For Change](https://sampledataforchange.github.io/) that I work on in my spare time.

Feedback is welcome and hope you find the data useful! I'm looking for more similar data sets to add to the project as well so any suggestions would be great.
