Does anyone know of any collection of transcripts for athletes or coaches who are being interviewed after a game? By postgame interview, I mean kind of interview where reporters ask the athlete/coach (usually seated in front of and facing everyone else) to describe what happened and what contributed to their win or loss. Ideally, the dataset would be in a script-like format, listing the speakers, and what they say in the order the questions were asked.
