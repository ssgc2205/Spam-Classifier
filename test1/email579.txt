Does anyone know where one could get a sample of real-time RFID scanning data?  E.g. from a warehouse or some inventory management system?  The ideal dataset would have some kind of time stamp for each scan, of course.

My thought on, "Why RFID specifically," is that there could potentially be a richer, higher resolution set of data than a barcode scanning scenario, in which an individual would need to be paid to sit there and scan things.

Failing RFID data...what about just bar code scans at various points in a warehouse?
