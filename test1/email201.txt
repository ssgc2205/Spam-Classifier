I've searched high and low on Kaggle, but I'm pretty new to this so I'm not sure what the best method of tracking down a good dataset is. I've been learning Python and Tableau to gain experience with marketing analysis tools and I'd really like to find a good dataset with ad campaign data.

Ideally this would be something with clicks, conversions, impressions, etc. Kinda like this dataset here:
