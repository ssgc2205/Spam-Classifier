Hello fellow data enthusiasts, apologies if this isn't the right sub.

I have access to vast amounts of economic and financial datasets (I'm a broker for CBRE) and have been wanting to write up neat reports to share with my audience and clients. However, my job has taken more and more hours and to balance my time I would like to work with others who enjoy making neat visuals, entertaining stories, and great writeups I could share with my audience and clients. 

Would pay for the work and co-brand the materials, just wondering if others out there have been in either side of a situation like this and what their thoughts and experiences were :)

Great sub!
