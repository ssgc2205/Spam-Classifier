So I'm writing my thesis for my master's program on the shortages of personal protective equipment in the United States during the first few months of the crisis. Basically why the supply chain could not react, why there were shortages, etc. I wanted to know if there was any data out there that I could utilize on this. ie., mask consumption pre and post production, mask/ gown/ faceshield production or distribution numbers, etc. There's plenty of COVID related data on infections but this is proving to be a little bit harder to find.
