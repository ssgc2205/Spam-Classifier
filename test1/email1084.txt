Some time ago I saw a graph of net income on the y-axis after all transfers and taxes and wage on the x-axis.
It was a beautiful piece of data because it clearly showed the poverty trap where net income decreases as wage increases only to catch up later. Anyone know where I can find this data? I'm especially interest in the United States and California.
