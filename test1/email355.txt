Hi r/datasets

&amp;#x200B;

I have a bachelors and masters degree in pure mathematics, both from the same college is of decent standing but by no means elite or exceptional in anyway. 

I was wondering how employable I am as a Data Scientist if ;

a) I have no computer science ability but extremely able to learn and learn quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

OR

&amp;#x200B;

b) I have some knowledge of python and machine learning algorithms in python but no way to validate have this knowledge via a resume or cover letter. 

I.e. I simply can write knowledge of these things on my resume or cover letter but an employer has no way of measuring or knowing how much I actually know.

&amp;#x200B;

If I am not currently employable what do you believe is the fastest route for me to become so?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is greatly appreciated.
