Hey guys I need a data set that is as current as possible for game releases, their maturity level, and date of release. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen the video game sales data set but there isnt very current data there for the past 5 years. I need to see the counts basically of how many games of each rating have been released in the last years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any guidance is much appreciated, 

thanks guys
