I was wondering if there was any way to get, say the percentage of people fully vaccinated in California on June 5th - as said by NYT? I tried the wayback machine ([example link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210420091356/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html)) but not all of the buttons work, and I can't imagine it would be very fast to collect data for all 50 states going back 'till Jan or Feb.
