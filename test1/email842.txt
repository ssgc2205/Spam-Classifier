Hey all! Iâ€™m looking for any datasets of organized destination events, the type of events that attract international travellers. For example:

**Sporting events**
- like World Cup, Super Bowl, Wimbledon, Olympics, marathons

**Music and Arts events**
- Such as Coachella, Burning Man, Fuji Rock, South Beach Food and Wine Festival

**Cultural events**
- like Mardi Gras, Brazilian Carnival, Trinidadian Carnival, Hajj

For my use case, I only need the event name and city but dates would be a bonus!
