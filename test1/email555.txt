I'm curious about how much time people spend on given tasks in a day based on profession. For example, A teacher might spend 50% of his day lecturing 40% of his day planning and 20% of his day doing administrative stuff. I recall some kind of info graphic that had a list of professions and the daily tasks associated with them ... A breakdown of the proportion or hours in each day would be especially useful.
