Hi. I'm looking for a data set that could essentially be a dump from a digital answer collection (or correction) system of a school / college, for research purpose. The data set must contain some sample correct answers, against which the students / respondents have submitted their answers, followed by an evaluation ( numerical marks) for each response. I tired searching for it online, but couldn't find one. I also checked a few similarity data sets such as the quora question similarity data set from their question pairs kaggle challenge, however it doesn't suit the purpose because - 1. Marks are absent, we're just required to tell if it is similar (1) or not (0) &amp; 2. There may not be enough similar or dissimilar responses for a particular question. 

I know it is a very typical request, but any kind of help will be very much appreciated! Thanks in advance!!!
