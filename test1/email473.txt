Hello All,

I am developing a event trading algorithm as my final master's thesis.  I am looking for a data set that has the date and time of major historical economic events.  As one example, I am interested in the date and time of every FOMC meeting minutes release for the last 20 years.  

The Fed website offers these dates but there don't immediately seem to be in a easily digestible form like a .csv file. [Example Data Source](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/) 

Do any of you know where I can get well-formatted data files that have these historical, as well as future events?

Thanks for any help you can provide.
