I'm messing around with image captioning neural networks and think my system would benefit from more data and a wider range of scenes in the training data. Does anyone have any suggestions for other datasets, or at least for places to scrape data from that might have what I'm looking for? Captions should describe the scene in a general way ("a bunch of cars that are parked in the snow" rather than "my car got stuck and I was late for work :(", for example), so just scraping image hosting sites or social media and leaving it at that strikes me as likely to be unhelpful.
