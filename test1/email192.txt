Hey all,
Trying to teach abstract data modeling and would appreciate a CSV or XLS of some sort of firearm catalog with manufacturer and specs.

Or

Firearms/ tanks / aircraft/ military equipment, plus some specs, plus appearance in war X.

Tldr: some sort of military or military history data set with several dimensions.

Thanks in advance.
