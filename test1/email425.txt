Seems like everything is gleaning data from us in our everyday lives...our phones, our cars, our f$$king coffee makers...

I'm assuming that these data-sets, can't all be silo'd on the individual app/product makers servers...leading me to speculate that there are data wholesalers out there.

Where can I find and/or buy data gathered from apps, phones, web services and other services?
