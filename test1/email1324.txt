I scraped their info from here:

[https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud-print/search](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud-print/search)

then did a tiny bit of tidying-up

then uploaded it to github:

[https://github.com/slowerthanlightspeed/reddit\_conversations/blob/master/voter\_fraud/heritage\_voter\_fraud.csv](https://github.com/slowerthanlightspeed/reddit_conversations/blob/master/voter_fraud/heritage_voter_fraud.csv)

&amp;#x200B;

(would love to be informed of any better, scrape-able resources)
