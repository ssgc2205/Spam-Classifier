I have a Master's in Psyc and a deep background in Inferential Statistics. I have studied multivariate statistics in graduate school and done contracts as a data scientist basically for NGO's. I want to take my career to the next level and get into a full-time data analysis type role and I am wondering whether I should do a boot-camp like Coursera or go back to school for a stem degree.
