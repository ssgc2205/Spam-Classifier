I'm trying to take a data analysis perspective as far as what to generally look at and consider for a house I'm planning to purchase. I don't know if there's a known resource regarding this, but anyway I could pull aggregate and specific data  within a zip code area would be amazing. List price, bedrooms/bathrooms, square footage, parking/yard/etc. Thanks for any help!
