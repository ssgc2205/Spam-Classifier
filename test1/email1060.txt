I have been analysing the Australian Population stats from the Australian Bureau of statistics ([link](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3235.02014?OpenDocument) and one of the stats is % of each suburb that is between 0-14,15-64 and 64+. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I was trying to get a number of people in each bracket for each suburb.


For some reason the sum of the people based on the percentage was not equal to the number of people given for each suburb

&amp;nbsp;



&amp;nbsp;

the issue was that some of the suburbs added up to 100.1% which man not sound like much but was causing as much as 332 more people to "exist" 

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR** Make sure your percentages add up to 100.
