Hello, I need help. I am. doing a project on mapping deforestation across Central America, and need to make a choropleth map in QGIS. I know how to make the map, but my problem is I have no clue where to actually find and download the data necessary for this project. Can anyone please help me find where I can download data files and shapefiles of Central American deforestation? Things that can then be put into QGIS to make a map of it all. Thank you, I am a huge beginner at this stuff.
