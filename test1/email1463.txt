I've played around with the NLS Data ([https://www.nlsinfo.org/](https://www.nlsinfo.org/)) and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study ([https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/)), but neither one gets as granular about the job functions in each role as I'm looking for. I'm interested in exploring the changes in an individual's job roles &amp; responsibilities over time (i.e. are they doing mostly technical functions, managerial functions, both, etc.), and looking for any differences that may exist between gender and race categories. Any idea if something like that exists?
