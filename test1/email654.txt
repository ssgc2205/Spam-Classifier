One of my work colleagues is looking for data I don't know how to find. Here's the broad parameters they gave me:

* Residential property tax rate data
* Average rates by county
* Wisconsin and Illinois
* 2008 to present

Any suggestions on where to find that data for either or both states, all states, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I have no experience at all looking for tax rate data.
