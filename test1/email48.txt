I'm a data science student who's psyched about the great opportunities in the field. Armed with nothing but enthusiasm and gut, I've ventured into the field by taking some python data science courses on datacamp, and udemy. In conjunction with a general introduction to python coding, I'm now familiar with the following python packages:

¶ Numpy
¶ Matplotlib
¶ Pandas

As a graduate of economics, I have a background in statistics and econometrics.

However, I believe there's more than meet the eyes in data science field. 

Sequel to that, I'm seeking an avenue by which I will get my hands dirty with real-world problems. I will best learn and build the necessary skills that way.

Therefore I am looking for someone I will assist in data science projects. No payment is required as I am not an expert yet. 

I will help you do some works, following your directions and on the process, I will develop some necessary skills.
