Should I worry about having a good IQ to become a data analyst? If I do need to worry about having a certain IQ what test would be best for me to take that is under $50 online? Dont recommend me a free one either because I know those are fake. To be more specific on what type of IQ test I'm looking for, I want one that can measure how well I am with analyzing things. Any recommendations for a test I could take?
