Dear Redditors, 

As the title says, I am looking for a dataset(s) that look at negative campaigning in Western Europe from 1995 onwards. I have had very little luck finding anything. I have found one dataset by Alessandro Nai, but it only covers 2016 onwards. The dataset doesn't need to be particularly detailed or even focus on negative campaigning - just so long as there is an element that focuses on Party a using negative tactics against Party b (and other parties and vice versa), that's enough. 

Any help on this would be most appreciated.
