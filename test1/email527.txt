Hello!  I'm working on an ML/analytics project and my group had an idea that requires data regarding youtube videos.

Ideally, the dataset would contain textual information from thousands of youtube videos, including title, duration, ads, views, likes, dislikes, etc.  Any ideas or links to datasets that would include such information?
