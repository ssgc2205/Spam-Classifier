Hi all! Long shot on some data that just might not exist, but what I am after is prices in middle eastern countries monthly at the country level. I have world price data, but could use more variation in the data. Also, ideally I'm looking for wheat/bread prices.

Middle east data may not stand out to you so if you have seen similar data for another region or commodity I'd love to hear where as it may lead me down a fruitful rabbit hole.

Thanks!
