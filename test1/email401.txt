Hello, as a sports betting enthousiast I've started modelling European competitions and betting on the matches played each week, with a reasonable succes. Now, in off-season, I web-scrape datasets for Scandinavian, South/North American (USA on next week) and Asian leagues. You can download the datasets, updated twice per week so you can use them for predictions, here; http://bookiebacker.com/
