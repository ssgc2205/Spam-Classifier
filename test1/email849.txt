Classes that I would take for it are. One major reason why I wanna do this is because it covers some General education courses I would've needed to take anyways

1. A GIS class
2. A digital marketing course
3. A digital art class like graphic design
4. A data analytics course
5. A programming class like C 

Also what kind of careers would go into with this minor that I could pursue in?
