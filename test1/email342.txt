Hello

I am an Msc Analytics students and was interested in doing a dissertation on data driven customer segmentation. My particular interest lies in life time value based segmentation (and / or other behavioural based segmentation) in retail / ecommerce (but can be any other industry as well). So I am looking for a data set which has 

a) transactions

b) demographics (with identifiers to link it with transactions)

c) any other behavioural / psychographic data (with identifiers to link it with transactions).

Thank you in advance!!
