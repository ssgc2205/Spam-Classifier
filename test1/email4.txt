What is colder than a witch's tits?

I have a dataset of  temperature readings from 444 pairs of tits, categorized by witch. and not a witch based on personal declaration. I have included ambient air temperature, barometric pressure, and the infrared thermometer's stats. What kind of insights could I glean from that data set, and how should I massage the data? Just working on the averages witch's tits are 1.048 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than Non-witches tits.
