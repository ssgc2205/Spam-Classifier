Hello Guys,

Quick idea: What if you had a dataset containing the nutritions and price of various food items? You could optimize your own diet!
Well.. now you can do exactly this! with the new dataset I uploaded to Kaggle.

You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/calculating-an-optimal-diet).

It contains nutritional values of household commodities. The dataset was used in the "stigler"-problem where ones tries to figure out how to minimise the costs of food while still getting enough nutrients.
It has more than 230 household Items along with their Price, Nutritional properties and some other features such as the Unit size, Vitamins Content, Protein Content and more.

Bon appetit!
