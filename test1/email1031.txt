I'm exploring some ideas about exact time during the diurnal cycle that death occurs.  Ideally, I'd like to know other things like age, latitude, exact time of birth, ethnicity, cause of death and basically anything other reliable data associated with the death event.

I know it sounds a little morbid, but I think it might be important when establishing millimort actuarials.
