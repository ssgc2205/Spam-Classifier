Hi! I've started a (basic) course in data analysis, and the final assessment is a project requiring "real world data". I'm honestly not sure where to start looking for what I want (once I come up with an idea of what I want to analyse heh, but that's not your problem!).

Is there a FAQ/list of popular data sources? I don't necessarily need it to be free, but I'm not a millionaire either, so go easy on me :)

Thanks!

EDIT: Editing in the list so far. So many wonderful resources I never knew about! Thank you all, such a cool community :)

https://www.google.com/ - might seem obvious, but actually it's great if you use the right terms. A search for "data ireland population yearly" got me a relevant hit immediately.

https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ - a search engine for data sets, very cool!

Will keep adding if people keep suggesting :)
