I scraped 50 000 abstracts to do some natural language processing, here if anyone else is interested: [csv in google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jcu62pkaGNIFm0XGp6r8gtmYeAmXqD5J/view?usp=sharing) Some of them are in Chinese though so there is some cleaning to do! I've scraped them from earliest to oldest.
