Hi guys,

I'm a new here.

Recently I am trying to develop something using Python.

What I need is CO2 emission data.

Could you guys recommend me an API of CO2 emission data?

Plotting CO2 emission data on y axis and x axis can be countries of the year, months, years of the country something like this.
