Hello ,

Just to let you know that I have upload a new version of my dataset on smart meter data in London that included:
-the smart meter data from the UK power grid project (on the london datastore)
-the details on the acorn groups
-weather data from dark sky api for the duration of the measurement

You can find the dataset at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london

If you have any suggestions, remarks open a discussion on Kaggle or let's talk on reddit !!
