I'm a journalist covering addiction and recovery in Boston, Massachusetts. Meth addiction is a problem here. But scientific experts and politicians alike are struggling to talk about it due to a lack of strong data. All we have is poorly delineated CDC data that does not separate meth out of the psychostimulant catagory. 

Please take a second to check out my article and, if anyone here has experience with addiction/drug use data, let me know if I'm missing any possible sources of info on meth.
