Here is a blog and code (created by a co-worker) that uses synthetic data generation to remove bias in the Adult Census Income dataset from Kaggle ([https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income)) by boosting minority classes such as gender, race, and income level in the dataset with synthetic records.

Hope you find this useful!
