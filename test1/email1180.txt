I’m having trouble finding an up to date data set for the UFC. The API’s I have found are either closed or limited and the data sets were all scraped years ago from sites that no longer seem to have the same info. 

Specifically, I’m looking for data on every fight and fighter who has ever completed in the UFC. So wins, losses, ages, locations, etc. 

Any ideas?
