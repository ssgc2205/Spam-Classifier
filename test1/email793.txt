Does anyone know of a database of highlighted texts? I'm not looking only for the highlighted excerpts, but the whole content in addition to the often highlighted parts.

I'm looking for any type of text that has been highlighted. The most common type would be entire books, but I'm not restricted to those.

For example, when I read something on my Kindle it shows me that a certain passage has been highlighted x number of times.

Any resources or directions of where to find such database is very welcomed!
