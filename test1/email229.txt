I'm working on a machine learning project that will use actors and the very first hit movie they premiered in. So far I have not had much luck on Kaggle looking at the [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset#movies_metadata.csv) or [TMDB 5000 movies](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata#tmdb_5000_movies.csv). I even looked at OMDB's API as well but I don't think I'll be able to use that either. Any suggestions?
