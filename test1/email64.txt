I remember seeing a post with a nice data visualization of multiple words (like sure, absolutely, maybe,...etc.) and how do people view these words in terms of certainty (?)  

So basically something like:  

Sure (people think that this indicates 80% certainty)  

Maybe (people think it means 40%)  

Doubt (people think it means 20%)  

And so on.  

It was a really cool chart and want to use it for something school related. Would really appreciate if someone could help out!
