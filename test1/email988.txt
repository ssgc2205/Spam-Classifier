Hello everyone. 

I'm looking for these datasets: 

*  CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database 
*  Replay-Attack dataset:
*  MSU Mobile Face Spoofing Database (MSU MFSD) 

Does anyone know where I can get these datasets? specially the  Casia Face Anti-Spoofing Database?

It seems the Casias link is dead and they do not respond to submission requests either. 

The Replay attack dataset wont accept students

So I'd greatly appreciate it if anyone could kindly share any of these or guide me to where I can get them.
