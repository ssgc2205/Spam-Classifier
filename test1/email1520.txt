Hello guys, I'm a statistics undergraduate student.

We have to do a school project which is to find data and to show normal distribution

using that data. So I have decided to find EPL players' height to represent a normal distribution.

From what I have learned in school, heights of EPL players will fall mostly close to the average.

I'm kind of excited to see that if it is true(I guess it has to be true.)

Do you guys have any idea where I can find the data for EPL players' height?

Thanks in advance.
