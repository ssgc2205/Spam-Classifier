I'm looking for interesting data sets for Women's Soccer. Ideally these are for international competition -- **Olympics, World Cup**, etc.  

Do you know of any of the following:

* Cleaned play by play data
* Speed/load data (how fast a player ran; total distance; etc.)
* Well-organized broadcast data
* Misc. - other interesting numbers/data sets?

Let me know if so. Much appreciated.
