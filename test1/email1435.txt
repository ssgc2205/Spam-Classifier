Hej, 

I am in search of a global dataset that collects data on casualties in conflicts. It seems like there is not much more than the UCDP data (Uppsala University) which has a threshold of 25 deaths for a conflict to be included in their data. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone has a hint for more detailed data?

Thanks!
