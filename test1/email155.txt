There is a math model of how much product street vendors should buy called the [News vendor model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsvendor_model). I am trying to figure out which distribution of sales do street vendors actually have. As in are the sales on any particular day normally distributed? To do this I would need a data set of "Fruit sales by street vendors by day" or something like that. But I cannot find one, Do you know a dataset that might do?
