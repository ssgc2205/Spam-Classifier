Hi Guys,
How are you today?

I've made made available a dataset containing answers to the The Generic Conspiracist Scale (GCBS) survey.

The Generic Conspiracist Scale (GCBS) was created for measuring belief in conspiracy theories.
When trying to measure belief in conspiracy theories, researchers had typically asked questions about specific conspiracy theories.
The GCBS attempts to correct this with the approach of asking broad questions about underlying assumption that are presumed to underlie such beliefs.
The GCBS measures an overall score and five facet scores.
This is a dataset of 2K Answers to the 15 scale rated questions along with 30+ other variables including demographics and technical information.

Credit for the original research paper: The scale was developed by Robert Brotherton, Christopher C. French and Alan D. Pickering of Goldsmiths University of London in 2013.

Have Fun!
