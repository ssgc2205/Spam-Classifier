I am going to perform bulk text analyses on articles corresponding to each 'side' (ex. left, center, right) of the USA political spectrum. I'm trying to find databases of news articles from differing sides to make importing into R easier. I know I can just go to news sites that are 'verified' as politically biased and download individual articles, but I'm wondering if there's any resources with bulk downloadable grouped pdfs (or something similar) which would help me save time.
