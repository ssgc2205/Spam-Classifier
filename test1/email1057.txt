Hii Redditors,

For a school project I'm looking for a large dataset that has interesting features to visualize in Tableau. Can anyone recommend me any sources (or even datasets) that I can work with? Any tips on what to pay attention to in regard to dataset features are also greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot from a beginner in data visualisation
