Hey all,

Hoping this might be the right place to ask if anyone is familiar with any 3rd party data suppliers that offer a data point on how many emails a company sends annually to their consumers/customers through their Email Service Provider? Paid is completely fine, I've exhausted my googling abilities to find anybody that would track/offer this data for corporations. Anything similar to a D&amp;B Hoovers that anyone has come across?

Thanks!
