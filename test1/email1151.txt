I have been looking for a data set that contains US Company Stock Market info for any subset of sectors Energy/Consumer/Finance/etc - with their daily price close 

Any help in pointing me towards the right compiled source will be much appreciated.

I tried google fin, but it only allows me to download 1 company at a time, and I am of the belief that this info exists compiled somewhere.

[Request] Stock Market historical Data

Data points
-Daily Price Close [Time span at least 10yrs] or Weekly Avg Price close
-Company Ticker/Name
-Sector
-Any other company financials
