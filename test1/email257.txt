Hello, I'm looking for an Excel file with (at a minimum) store address, city, state, zip for these retailers: Tractor Supply (n=1,965), Menard's (n=352), Sherwin-Williams (4,148). These companies use a store locator on their websites that make it difficult to pull a full store directory. Anyone know how to pull this data? Thank you!
