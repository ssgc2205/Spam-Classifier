 Hi all! I have been building my own satellite imagery dataset using USGS. I want to gather images that cover the whole surface of Europe and I have been doing this over each tile (path/row) by hand. Is there a way that I can do this process faster? Maybe a way to search for multiple places at once or some way to choose larger surfaces? Any leads are more than welcome, thanks in advance!
