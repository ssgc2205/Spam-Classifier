Hi all, my colleague is planning on sending a very large dataset of social media posts from a variety of sources (i.e. Twitter, Discord, online forms, etc.) in a few different formats but mostly csv files. I'd like to identify broad themes in the social media postings, but I'm admittedly new to qualitative analysis (my training has been traditional quant). Is there software that automatically analyzes posts for themes or do all software programs require some sort manual coding? Given the enormous quantity of data I'm admittedly daunted by having to manually code or identify nodes. Any leads or suggestions much appreciated!
