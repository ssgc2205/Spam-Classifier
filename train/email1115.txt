I know this is probably a strange and unusual dataset for this subreddit... 

I ended up with this because I wanted to search for certain words Snoop Dogg might have said in a song, so I can sample them. 

Half of the files are completely plain text of just the song title and lyrics, and will require zero to little cleanup. 

The other half have javascript and other crap that needs cleaned up from my rough scraping. Still makes for an interesting dataset, I suppose.

Have at it: [Zip File download - contains 310 plain text files](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iy7bjr65yg14meg/snoopdogglyrics.zip?dl=0)
