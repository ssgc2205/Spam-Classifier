Hi all,

I'm wondering if anyone knows where I can find soccer datasets that include player salary as well as player statistics such as goals, seasons, assists, etc. Any league will do. 

I'm looking to create a multiple linear regression showing a relationship between salary and a number of variables.   


Thank you for your help.
