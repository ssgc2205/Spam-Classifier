So Zillow only allows you to pull data of a specific address. It doesn’t allow you to pull all data from a specific region or even narrow it down further. 

I’m just trying to get recently sold house data such as price, sq ft, beds, baths, etc for my zip code. Is there any way I can get a list of addresses that were recently sold that I can plug into zillow? Does anyone have any ideas how I can get my hands on this data other than scraping the mls which is a big no no. 

For example, would like my county website have data on property sales? Are there any other 
websites out there with this data and an api? 

My ultimate goal is to do some house price prediction based on different factors using machine learning. I’m trying to avoid using zestimates which is why I want recently sold houses so I can just use the sale price. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated
