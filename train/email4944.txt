I'm interested to see a graph of incidents of violent crime compared to number of civilians killed by law enforcement.  I know recent articles have suggested that the FBI's numbers for the latter are low/bad/incomplete/a joke, but I'd like to see the graph anyway.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to where to get quality data for this graph?  TIA.

**EDIT:**  I should have specified that I'm looking for nationwide data for the US.  Thanks.
