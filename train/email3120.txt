I am looking for individualized student loan debt by principal and interest rate. So far I have only been able to track down consolidated national views of the data. Ideally it would look something like this:  


&amp;#x200B;

|Student ID|Loan Borrowed/Outstanding|Interest Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Student 1|$5,000|4.5%|
|Student 1|$10,000|5.3%|
|Student 1|$3,000|5.5%|
|Student 2|$20,000|15.1%|
