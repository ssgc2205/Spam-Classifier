I'm teaching SQL to a friend at work, and looking for an interesting political database, that can be spun up locally, for them to query against for practice. Does anyone know where to find a database like that? Ideally it would be something similar to the Adventureworks database, flexible and easy to import. Google turned up a few import-able databases, but couldn't find anything politically based (at least without needing to stitch together unrelated tables).
