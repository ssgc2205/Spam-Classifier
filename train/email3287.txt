Hey Lads and Ladies 

Do you any of you know where I could find a database of major capital projects currently underway in the different regions (NAM, Latam, Africa, Europe, CIS, MENA, ANZ). I am interested in the following information in order of priority: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Description
* Capital cost ($m)
* Industry / commodity â€“ if mining, include commodity (e.g. gold/iron      ore/coal/etc); otherwise, just include industry (e.g. infrastructure (road      / rail / etc) / manufacturing)
* Stage (e.g. design, feasibility, construction, commissioning)
* Key decision makers

thanks in advance,
