I am working on  a project where I have to create a classifier that takes as input an image with a door or a window and decide if it is open or closed (possibly partially open also). I did some research and there seems to be a number of papers that treat this subject (especially for doors) but I haven't yet found a dataset I can use to create my solution. So if any one has (knows about) a dataset that might be useful in my case I would appreciate that.
