I'm looking to create a rudamentary image to image GAN taking in climate data or biome maps and generating artificial satellite imagery from it. Unfortunately it seems I've been having a very difficult time finding suitable data at anything better than "hastily pasted and deformed world biome map from google pasted over satellite imagery".

Because of this I've started making my own dataset, but not only is it slow work but it's also not of great quality.

Hopefully somewhere out there there's a better dataset floating around.
