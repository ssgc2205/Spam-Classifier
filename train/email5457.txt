Hi all,   
I'mLooking for shopping and stores at NYC (Manhattan to be exact) with name, address, category   
I found this [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=Lower%20Manhattan%20Retailers&amp;sortBy=relevance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=Lower%20Manhattan%20Retailers&amp;sortBy=relevance)  
but it's only for lower Manhattan,  


Anyone know of such dataset?   


Thanks for the help
