Hi there, I would like a dataset that includes some kind of personality data from as representative a sample of the US as possible. As such I am wary to use data compiled from an online test or social network analysis. I will be using it in conjunction with economic/job/health data to answer some questions I've had on my mind after that guy got fired from google (he distributed a memo attacking google's efforts to hire more women and minorities). If I manage to come up with some answers, I may eventually publish my analysis online.

It must have gender and age information and ideally would have location and income information. Also, It must have at least 10,000 data points, 50-100 would be awesome! Bonus points for sets that include children. A smaller set that tracks participants from a young age would be excellent too.

It would really make my weekend if someone could point me in the right direction! I've been looking for quite a while today with no luck.

Thank you!
