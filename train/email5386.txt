Might be a long shot, but does anyone know where I could get data on the coin toss at the beginning of NCAA Football games? Iâ€™m mostly interested in D1, but would be happy with any level. Just need it to include who played, which team won the toss, and ideally the date. I can fill in the blanks with information from other sources if I can just track this part down.

Thanks!
