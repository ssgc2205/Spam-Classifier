I am looking for a timeline of state mandated business capacities for all 50 US states since March 2020. Specifically, bars and restaurants would be nice, but general business mandates would work. 

I'm trying to do an analysis of sales and the correlation to mandated closures due to coronavirus to create some type of crystal ball forecasting. Really all I need is state, date, and % capacity. Any ideas on where I could find this would be appreciated!
