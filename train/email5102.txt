I ran out of potential good data sets to use for my graduate level course to teach supervised and unsupervised learning. I am looking for a data set that is not wine quality, iris, or anything as those popular datasets. I already have used crime data from city open data portals and would like something realistic as the open data portal but that would show good or near good results for supervised and unsupervised learning models so my students can see what are considered good models so when they do their assignments or use the material for work they already realistically know if they created good or bad models. Any help would be appreciated and thank you in advance.
