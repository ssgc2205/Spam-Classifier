1)Goal is to understand movements on a month by month basis, 2) and over the quarter.

Suggestions on best ways to tackle this?

- pivot table - not sure how that would help. If you put the row labels/y axis as company names, values on the x axis, you can sort by largest to smallest for each month but that change would 'disappear' doing it for each month so you wouldnt be able to track anything
- simply sorting by largest to smallest - would help trace through or see the trend for specific companies

Would be grateful for any suggestions/happy to compensate for time. Want to make sure im not missing anything vlookups/lookups that could be useful ?
