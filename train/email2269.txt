Hello everyone,

I have been able to find very scarce fruit and vegetable budget data at the state level. Mostly from colleges and the like and I was wondering if anyone here knew about a larger dataset. 

Ideally the dataset would provided information regarding production costs for fruits and vegetables (e.g. blueberries, apples, grapes, green beans, squash, sweet corn) for each county in the United States for a given year. Furthermore it would split these costs in labor, maintenance, depreciation, etc.

I know itâ€™s a tall order but even a small lead would help!
