Hi- Iâ€™m moving to NYC shortly and was hoping to be able to analyze up-to-date data about rentals, specifically I wanted to construct some models to explore how amenities like pets allowed, washer/dryer in unit/building, distance to subway, communities distance to downtown Manhattan, etc, affect mean prices &amp; time on market. Initially I thought to scrape data off of streeteasy, but of course they blocked it and it violates their user policy. Any ideas for how I could get my hands on data like this? Thanks for any ideas!
