I need to access to linkedin data to have a sense on some employment movement. So far I have use google search using "linkededin.com/in/". Surprising to me, today I see a profile with "linkedin.com/pub/". I am not sure what it is. Can someone help enlighten me? 

Also, how many linkedin.com directories should I need in order to get a most exhaustive dataset of linkedin individual profiles?
