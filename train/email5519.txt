First reddit post ever guys.

I'm trying to find some good dataset leads. Specifically, investigating the market size of potential Senegalese female investors -- potential high net worth individuals, % of women at X, Y, Z socioeconomic or income level, etc. I've looked at the WB's World Development Index and the UN's Human Development Index.

Any suggestions, send 'em my way please.
