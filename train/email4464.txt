Hi everyone.

I want to attempt to create a sentiment analysis template on my company's tool (VAYU - [here](https://www.gyana.co.uk/vayu)) but I don't know where I can find the right data to use. I want to look at the sentiment of a novel. I'm a complete noob! I mean...do I just import an ePub? haha! 

Sorry for my stupidity! Thanks!
