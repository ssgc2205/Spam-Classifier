Is there any website i can use that offers an api or something to extract the data? I found many sites that shows demographic data per census tract but there no way to extract the data.


I'm looking at all the censustract in all the counties in NYC and a few other counties in NY. I tried many census websites but I cant find the data I want. 

My data should look something like (main columns being the geoid or a combination of county name and the census tract so i can pin point where the tract is):

&amp;#x200B;

|geoid|census tract Name|Population in census tract|percent of people under 18 years old|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|360610092001003|Census Tract 92|3000|20%|
