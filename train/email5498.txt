I am having a difficult time finding a dataset with the following data points:

* Part Number (more than 10 Part Numbers)
* Defect Quantity
* Defect Reported On (Date)

Bonus data points:

* Defect Responsible (Supplier or Production)
* Supplier Name (if Supplier Responsible)

Ideally the analysis is identify future part defects based upon historical data, so data based on more than a year would be great. I tried looking in Kaggle, and they have the Bosch dataset which doesn't met the needs for my request. 

Any support is appreciated. If you are able to find me the dataset that meets my request, I don't mind gifting a $20 Amazon card for this trade. 

Thank you in advance!
