Hi,

I am looking for datasets of Java projects which display plagiarism; from direct copying to more significant obfuscation, e.g. changing names, rearranging structure, and modifying inconsequential fields. The purpose is to train a plagiarism detection and classification algorithm. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks.
