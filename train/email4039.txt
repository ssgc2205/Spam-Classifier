I am a graduate student in Epidemiology looking to work on a project relating sweetened/sugary beverages ad exposure to diabetes prevalence in particular regions of the southeast. 

Any recommendations? I am hoping to have free and open datasets, but I can pay a small fee if needed. I just have googled a million different combinations of that request, all to no avail.
