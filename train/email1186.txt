Hello everyone, I'm looking for a dataset of ads (hopefully Google Ads) that have info such as the amount paid, amount of clicks, ad text, ad website, amount impressions, and any other data that can be associated with ads. It would be very helpful if anyone can drop down a link to a site that might have this type of data! :)

Thanks
