Hi all, 

I'm looking for a historical dataset of premier league statistics that has a link between an individual player and the team that he played for.  There are a lot of datasets, but none that I can find that have, for example, a team table and a player table where there is some sort of team id in the player table that links the player to the team they played on.

If can someone can point me to a dataset with this feature, I'd be grateful.

Any help is appreciated.
