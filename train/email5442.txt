Hello y'all. As a soon-to-be first-time home buyer and a student of mathematics in Toronto, my interest was piqued when I came across a set of detailed anonymized mortgage data on Kaggle. 

 [https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/ny-home-mortgage](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/ny-home-mortgage) 

I am curious there are similar legislation in Canada like the US'  *Home Mortgage Disclosure Act* (*HMDA*) . 

And if there are, are there any sources for this sort of data in Canada, free or licensed? 

&amp;#x200B;

For the sake of completeness, here are some important columns from the us data set: 

 action\_taken

action\_taken\_name

agency\_code

agency\_name

applicant\_ethnicity

applicant\_ethnicity\_name

applicant\_income\_000s

applicant\_race\_1

applicant\_race\_name\_1

applicant\_sex

applicant\_sex\_name

application\_date\_indicator

as\_of\_year

census\_tract\_number

co\_applicant\_ethnicity

Thank you everyone here at the reddit hivemind.
