Hi,

Surprisingly, I cannot find a full list of US Zipcodes with their associated MSA. 

I'm fine to purchase this if need be. 

Best help I've found so far: [https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/4825/how-can-i-get-a-full-list-of-us-zipcodes-with-their-associated-names-csas-msas-l](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/4825/how-can-i-get-a-full-list-of-us-zipcodes-with-their-associated-names-csas-msas-l)

Thank you for any help!
