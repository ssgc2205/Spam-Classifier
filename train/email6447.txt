Hello mates,  


Here's a steam reviews dataset, containing a little more than 6.4 million observations.

You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/steam-reviews).

  
It was taken on 2017 and all credits are due to the following authors:

&gt; Antoni Sobkowicz. (2017). Steam Review Dataset (2017) \[Data set\]. Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1000885](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1000885)

Cheers
