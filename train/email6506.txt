I am looking to see if the time points of ticket sales for a concert are available from one site and resale ticket time points on a separate site are available or have been recorded. For example ticketmaster and stubhub. I'm not sure if this data is available  or anyone has looked into this data before. The motivation is bot ticket purchases and businesses who buy with the sole intention of resale.
