 I want to scrape massive amounts of google trends data (i.e. 1800 requests for about 5000 keywords) I've tried using proxy-cheap, but based on its performance so far, the total cost will tally up to be alot (around $5000). Does anyone know a cheaper alternative to this or another method that could help make this solution cheaper or know somewhere I could find an already cleaned dataset online?
