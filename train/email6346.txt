Looking for a heart disease diagnosis dataset by United States County by year.

The closest thing I've been able to find is deaths, e.g. on CDC Wonder. What I'm really looking for is diagnosis.

So stated otherwise, I'm looking for a dataset with - number of new Heart Disease cases by year by county.

Thank you!
