Hello everyone,

I am currently looking for some financial data for a project I'm doing, I'm gonna have to apply some credit risk modeling algorithms, and get results similar to [these](https://www.intechopen.com/books/financial-management-from-an-emerging-market-perspective/modeling-default-probability-via-structural-models-of-credit-risk-in-context-of-emerging-markets). If you know how I can get such data, please reply. Thank you.
