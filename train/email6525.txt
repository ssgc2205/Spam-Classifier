Hi there,
I'm a hardstyle fan and recently I've started a little project that involves gathering all the hardstyle artists out there. I've found a huge list on [Partyflock.nl](https://partyflock.nl/artist/searchresult?NAME=&amp;TYPE%5B%5D=dj&amp;GENDER=&amp;COUNTRYID=&amp;GID%5B%5D=5&amp;GID%5B%5D=9&amp;GID%5B%5D=64). The list exists out of artist names which are also hyperlinks to the exclusive page of one artist in particular. Here's an example: https://imgur.com/a/jjxzM. There are famous and totally unknown artists in there. I wish to filter the famous from the unknown. I thought of a way by doing this: each artist page has a number of fans. My goal is to create an Microsoft Excel sheet with all the artists from this list, combined with their fan-count. Does anyone know a tool for me in order to do this? Any other help is welcome as well, ofcourse. Thanks in advance!

Edit: forgot to include raw hardstyle dj's in the link. This contains all the artists I want to analyze: https://partyflock.nl/artist/searchresult?NAME=&amp;GENDER=&amp;COUNTRYID=&amp;GID%5B%5D=41&amp;GID%5B%5D=48&amp;GID%5B%5D=52&amp;GID%5B%5D=55&amp;GID%5B%5D=5&amp;GID%5B%5D=9&amp;GID%5B%5D=64
