As title says,  I'm looking for datasets of CG, video data (could be saved as frames), preferably from video games. I need real life actions (driving, flying etc.), rather then just models (I found some kitchens and stuff but I'm looking to detect from similar to real life situations).

This is for a university project, so no commercial use will be done.

Appreciate your help.
