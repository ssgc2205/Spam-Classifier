I am trying to get US Population by census block.. Ideally the data should include FIPS code.

It is the first time I go that deep into US Census data and I am thoroughly confused. 

Here are the the resources I have found so far
https://www2.census.gov/census_2010/03-Demographic_Profile/
https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-data.html
https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml

But I could not find a file that would have what I am looking for. 
Multiple resources were linking to tiger-data, but how do I deal with *.shp files?
And it just seems wasteful to assemble everything from state-level files. 

There must be somewhere a file with a full block-level population stats?
