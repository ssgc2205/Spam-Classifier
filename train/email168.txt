So what I want to do is pretty specific, and after an extensive search, I have not come across a dataset that contains this.
I want to compare different metrics for automatic speech recognition evaluation. It could be useful to have a corpus containing the following to have something to compare against.


reference | hypothesis | usefulness score
---|---|----
original text | ASR hypothesis | (mean) score for the hypothesis found in a survey

My hopes aren't too high as this is a very niche thing to look for, but nevertheless, I figured I could ask here.

I got the idea form here: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.441.6817&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf
