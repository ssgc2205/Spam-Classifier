I am looking for Infrared Scans and data sets. Ideally from arial photogrammetry and have radiometric and GIS meta data associated with them.   We are developing software for disaster management, emergency services and SAR.  location doesn't matter but content would be ideal the more interesting the better example) scans of animals or humans, wildfires,  urban and rural areas.  

Any leads I can get the better we and sort through bugs in the software.
