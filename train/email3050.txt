How does someone quire info on a particular companies sales for particular items they sell? Example: How many work gloves are sold by mechanix (a glove company) annually? 

I know this is an odd thing to ask but i cant seem to find this information on the internet for some reason but i know reddit has more research skillzz than i ever will. 

Anyway here is a bit of my back story which explains why i need this info, if anyone cares.

I'm a 23 year old kid from NH who was presented with an idea for a new product a few years back by a friend. I honestly believe this product has a lot of potential so I proposed we create a company based around this product and file a provisional patent. Fast forward to now we have successfully created and an LLC and still hold the  provisional patent rights to the product, i know it took a little while but we did it right and have only invested a few grand so far. I am currently in contact with multiple companies that are providing me quotes for design as well as manufacturing costs. One thing these companies need from me is a ROM or Rough Order Magnitude(at least the most accurate one i can come up with anyway). This now brings me to my current dilemma, i know the questions i need answered but dont know if these answers are available to the public.

Such questions include: 
how many work gloves did certain companies sell annually.
How many hard hats sold in us annually.
How many high visibility vests were sold annually.
Things like that..

I apologize for my grammer, spelling and general ignorance im sure im showing to all you fine redditers. And also sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit.
