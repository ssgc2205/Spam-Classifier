Anyone have any ideas on how to clean Header Records/ACH Company IDs from ACH NACHA formatted records (but stored in a db2 format)?

If you are familiar with ACH data, you know that the Company Name is likely meaningful to a human, but it is very inconsistent to a machine and cleaning the data. For example, Walmart might be WALMRT #134 in the ACH dataset, but to us, it means WALMART. 

Anyone at FI's ever looked at this data? How to clean it up? Make it useful?
