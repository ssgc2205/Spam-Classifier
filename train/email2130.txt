I'm having a difficult time finding raw datasets on sexual assault... mostly finding pdfs of conclusive reports. I know the material is sensitive, but any idea where to find some datasets? My hopes are to apply statistics to profiles for either victims or perpetrators, data science style study. Thanks for any thoughts...
