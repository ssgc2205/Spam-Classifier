I want to learn what the most popular part of a city to photograph is, and want to use Instagram as one way of finding out. How can I collect data for the no. of Instagram photos in different parts of a city without individually counting each one? And how can I measure the no. of these Instagram photos taken by locals against the no. of Instagram photos taken by visiting tourists (taking nationality/alternative on Instagram as a suggestion for each)?
