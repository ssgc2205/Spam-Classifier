Hello everyone. I am currently working on a marketplace where anyone can share their dataset (images, sounds, etc.) with the world. The idea is that after you have solved your ML task, you are left with the dataset which you don't mind sharing with others. So why not make some money out of this. Please, comment if you faced the problem that you couldn't find a dataset for the problem you were trying to solve and would be happy if such a marketplace would exist. I am also interested in the legal side of such a business. Are there any problems if the dataset was containing some copyrighted images and the client tried to sell them.
