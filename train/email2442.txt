 Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'll give it a go. I am currently taking a Financial Econometrics course focusing on time series analysis and for our final project, we must perform a time series analysis on any topic that we want. I am having a very difficult time deciding on a topic that is (a) interesting, (b) has easily accessible data, and (c) not too difficult. This is my first time learning about time series analysis so I would prefer something on the easier end of the spectrum. I've been trying to research topic ideas for 3 days and have had no luck so far. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
