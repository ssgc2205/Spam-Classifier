I'm sorry if this has already been compiled in part or in full somewhere already, I was thinking a dataset that had all the factors useful for deciding where to buy a home and settle down in the US would be a very, very fun dataset to poke through. Such a directory for other countries would also be interesting...But, with differences in government structure and the like between countries, I don't know if that would be the best data to couple together in any useful or advisable form.
