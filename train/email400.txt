Hey fellow Redditors,

I am looking for a dataset which has music files availaible in mp3/wav/ogg or anyother audio format. It would be plus if that dataset has only the music sounds and not the lyrics stuff.

So far I was able to find only  [FMA: A Dataset For Music Analysis](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) dataset like that. 

Thank You in advance
