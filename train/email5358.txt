Of course, I know the big all-encompassing research sets like COW and POLITY, but I was wondering if anyone else knows good data/articles for this. I am specifically researching the relationship between freedoms of speech/press and how they relate to public sentiment or the sentiment of the press. Does anyone know good research or data on this? 

This college student will greatly appreciate it!
