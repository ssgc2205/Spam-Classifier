is a list of charts of soldier pay since 1949.  I was hoping some excel ninja could compare this to inflation to easily show people.

I'm a Major in the Army, and I'm in Afghanistan.  I know my benefits are going to get cut.  but i need to keep my guys to keep working and help us fully retrograde out of this place.   Maybe some soldiers will see this and think,  "Well my dad did the same thing for less, I'll keep working." 

Its hard to stay motivated out here.  I need some help.
