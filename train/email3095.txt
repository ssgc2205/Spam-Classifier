Hi Reddit,

I am looking for **demographic data on different countries in Europe**. I am now mainly focusing in **income by postal code**. I  am not really finding anything on most *National Statistical Insitutes*, either these do not provide the data, (not so granular or not available at all). I also saw some visualizations on [OCDE](https://data.oecd.org) for all countries, but no data provided (or not found). I have nevertheless found some companies that provide this data like INFAS360 in Germany (obviously not for free).

**So my questions are:**

\- Where can I get data for income by postal code in European countries, if available through free sources?

\- Which are the best companies to address as an alternative to free sources? (One company for all Europe better than separate companies for each data set...)
