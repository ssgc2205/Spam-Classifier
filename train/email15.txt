Hello all, I'm working on creating distributed computing materials for highschool level students which can be done on raspis.  


I'm looking for datasets thats are 100GB + in size, probably no bigger than 2TB.  Also examples of analysis which could be done on them which would be interesting and understandable to those students.  


My first effort is import the rapid7 sonar datasets of DNS queries (\~Billion row database).
