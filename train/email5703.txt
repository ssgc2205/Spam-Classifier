Unfortunately, I am not the most computer savvy person, and honestly, wouldn't even know the correct metric to measure internet usage in general, let alone on a state by state basis, so I do not have any relevant data to contribute.

I am in the process of writing to my State Senator regarding Net Neutrality Legislation in California. I want my proposal to be as thorough as possible. I may not understand the finer points of net usage, but I do understand the general dread over throttling and increased "tiered" fees. I also know, from a lifetime of experience, that Telecoms will do whatever is absolutely worst for their customers at all times.

I am trying to show my Senator that California accounts for X% of all internet traffic in the United States. Considering we account for roughly 8.5% of the nation's population, I'd imagine we also account for a similarly large slice of all nationwide traffic/usage.

Similar to the way California's passage of increased gas mileage legislation basically forced car manufacturers to meet our standards or lose the largest auto market in the US, I am hoping that if we enact state NN legislation, we could force Telecoms to fall in line or lose the largest market in the country.

Once California falls... My hope is that other states will fall like dominoes with similar legislation.

Anyway... I am hoping someone with a better grip on the actual figures needed - showing how much internet traffic/usage California accounts for - can help me out with some good data representation.

Thanks so much for any and all help!!
