Hey,

Is there any place where I can find a dataset with the median wage per country, worldwide (not the average wage)?

Average wage is available from the International Labour Organisation, but I'm yet to find data on the median wage. I know the OECD must have them, since they publish the data on the [minimum wage relative to the median wage](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/data/earnings/minimum-wages-relative-to-median-wages_data-00313-en), but as far as I could find, the statistics on the median wage are not disclosed.

Any help?

Thanks!
