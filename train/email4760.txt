Hello all!

I am a current MUP student and am looking for data related to the number of startups (or percentage of businesses that are small businesses) by year and metro. I am looking to find out if the percentage of businesses that are considered small businesses in Rochester, NY have increased since the 60's. I assume the number of startups by year in rochester would give me a similar idea but I can't find any of this info through the census or BLS or anything else...

Anyone know where I could find this?
