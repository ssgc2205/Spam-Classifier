Hello,

For a project I am working on I am curious if there happens to be any datasets for products specifically more geared towards like gaming-related things that had tags. The main idea I have is being able to like link up searches for like gaming headsets or gaming monitors etc.

Would appreciate anything you guys might know about.

Thanks!
