I am investigating future prevalence of Cholera in Kenya due to climate change scenarios (IPCC AR4). 

The best data i have found is from the Kenyan government disease surveillence network (http://www.ddsr.or.ke/idsr/index.php/bulletins) but frankly its rubbish! It's nominally located (not GPS coodinates).

Please please if anybody has Geolocated Cholera data (could be vector  point data, raster heat map, anything) for Kenya, please let me know. My Degree is on the line.

I am quite happy to pay for the data, but I am only a student so a modest sum will be all i can afford.

Thanks,

Patrick
