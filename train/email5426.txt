Any suggestions about the best website or source for NFL injury data. I am a student attempting to finish research to graduate and trying to find a more in-depth record. I am mostly looking at concussions but I have no problem sorting through a database of all injuries if necessary. The website I was looking at (Pro Football Reference) only goes back to 2009. I was hoping to get data going back further than that, maybe even back to 2000. Any ideas?
