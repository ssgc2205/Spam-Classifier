Hi,

I‘m looking for a dataset of labor replacing technologies’ penetration at ideally country-industry-occupation level. I have worked with the usual one of the IFR of robots per country, but now I am looking for a broader definition of a labor replacing tech, like AI penetration or something like that.

Any ideas? Thank you in advance!
