Have any of you guys seen NBA stats records with the real time an event happened?  I'm not interested in the game clock - I'm looking for the time the event actually happened.

For example, if I look at the [play by play of tonight's GSW/OKC game via ESPN](http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400876754), I see that Stephen Curry scored a 1 pointer at the 10:27 mark of Q1.  With a game start of 6p PST I can estimate that event happened at 6:01:33 PM (1 minute 33 seconds after the start of the game), but I know it's probably not accurate due to game clock stoppages (time outs, commercials, official reviews, etc..).

Use case is to do some analysis for a data science class.  I've been searching around various sport stat sites but haven't tripped on anything yet.

Any pointers on where to find this or how to estimate it?
