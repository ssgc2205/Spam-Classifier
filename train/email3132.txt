Hi all, I am looking for any and all space related data.  If possible coordinate data for as many stars, asteroids, planets, etc. as possible.

The goal I have set for myself is making a map of nearby objects in space (and their movement) using earth as a focal point.

So far I have found some star catalogs on my search, but I was wondering if there is a database/dataset anyone knows of with up-to-date information on objects in space.  
  
  
Edit: So far I have found a couple resources  
- This has dataset links in the bottom left of the site http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/  (only image data?)  
- There is a "Minor Planet Center" website with datasets here http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB.html  
  
  
Edit 2: Thank you for the replies!  Please keep them coming!
