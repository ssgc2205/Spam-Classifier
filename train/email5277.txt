I have put up some (not so few) parse trees online as a dataset. Not something as substantial as Penn Treebank, since the trees are not human-edited, but still way more parse trees than from Penn to feed into your later-stage NLP algorithms, free of charge or hassle.

The current format is straight from where they were generated. Suggestions of alternative formats based on ease of use would be heavily appreciated!
