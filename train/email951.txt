I wanted to learn google analytics by exploring the data set that is generated by websites. I have found a sample data set of only 63 records in google big query( https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3416091?hl=en ). Does anyone know if I can find some large data set at least having few thousands records with similar attributes .
