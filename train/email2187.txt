Hi everyone, I am subject in Business Intelligence, and I need to look for data on what products in Cadbury brand were sold the most per country. I have used alot of search terms but come up with nothing that is relevant. 
Has anyone got any suggestions on how I would find this kind of data?

Cheers for your help!
