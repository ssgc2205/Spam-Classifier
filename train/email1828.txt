I wasn't expecting this to be so difficult to find but here I am.  I'm looking for historical precipitation data (by day, week, or month - I'm not fussy) broken down by county or zip code.  Every website I find makes you search for a single zip code or county while I want the whole shabang.  Doesn't need to go back very far - just 1 year or so.  Any ideas?
