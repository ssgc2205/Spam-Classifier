Hi,  


I'm looking for a dataset which includes neutral tweets, to be used during training of a naive bayes classifier. So far I have found the Sentiment140 dataset which includes 1.6 million tweets (800 000 positive/negative). I would like to have a third sentiment, for neutral tweets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do anyone know where I can find such dataset? I found T4SA dataset but unfortunately you need a password to download the dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

Much appreciated,

Nowarez
