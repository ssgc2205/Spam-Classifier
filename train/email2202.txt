Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping to put together some visuals which highlight the human rights attacks from China to the Uighur's in Xinjiang. I know this is a bit broad but here's of examples examples of what would be really helpful:

* Re-education camp location and sizes
* Growth in Uighur related facial recognition academic papers

Thanks for all help!
