Hello r/datasets, first time posting here, so please go easy on me. I'm thinking about doing a project studying the effects of green roofs on city temperatures and was hoping someone could help jump start my data search. 

I'm wondering if anyone has leads on finding data for city temperatures over a long time period. It could be averages by month, daily readings, or yearly averages for all I care. In a perfect world, this dataset would look something like this: 

city|year|average temperature

NYC|2017|70

NYC|2016|71

Singapore|2016|82

Singapore|2015|84

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone would be able to point me the right way, I'd appreciate it!
