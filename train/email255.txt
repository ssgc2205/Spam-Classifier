We are looking for a national set of data with consumer spending behaviors by the block group, minimally, so that we can illustrate different marketing approaches for different areas (by block group, etc.). As an example, people here tend to respond to direct mail at X rate, or buy goods via direct mail / catalog, or tend to buy online, etc. Does anyone know the best resource for this? We are looking to buy or retain the data ourselves, too, so it can be hosted on our server... Any help is huge. Thanks guys.
