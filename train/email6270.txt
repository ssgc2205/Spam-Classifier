For example, if in one data set there's an entry for John Doe living at 1111 2nd Ave and in another data set there's an entry for John Doe living at 1111 2nd Ave*nue.* I'm creating an exercise for my students that works with data cleaning and combining data sets. I want them to figure out a way to identify whether or not two entries actually are the same person or if it's more likely that they are actually two separate people.
