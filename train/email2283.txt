Hello guys! Recently, I started to work on a project connected to bird song recognition. I have managed to find quite a few datasets and gathered them, along with other resources, in one place. Feel free to check my repo - [https://github.com/AgaMiko/Bird-recognition-review](https://github.com/AgaMiko/Bird-recognition-review) 

Maybe someone will find it useful. Also, feel free to pull a request if you want to add something, or just simply write it here - I will try to add it to the repo as fast as possbile.
