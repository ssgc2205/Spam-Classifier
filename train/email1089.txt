Where can I find data of total corporate (or simply any donation) to political parties/candidates over time? 

There may be another way about this. Here's my hypothesis. Starting in the 1970s the wealth inequality gap started to increase - was this around the time corporations started more heavily contributing to political candidates? Yeah yeah yeah, correlation and causation, either way, it's interesting to me.
