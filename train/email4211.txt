I want to research astrology and I'm looking for a dataset that includes birth dates, income, occupation, death date and cause of death, etc. I found astro databank [https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Main\_Page](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Main_Page) but it is not in a format that I can download and use for my research. So I was wondering if you know any other resource.
