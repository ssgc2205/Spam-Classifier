This questionnaire is the 28-item Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and the 63-item Dissociation Questionnaire (DIS-Q) combined. Twenty questions overlap between the two questionnaires, so the DIS-Q versions of those questions were omitted, making the total number of questions 71, plus four demographic questions.

This link will expire in 30 days. I don't have a better place to upload it. If the link is expired and you want access to the dataset, just message me.

I'll analyze the data in the comments below for a week or two, until I start something else.
