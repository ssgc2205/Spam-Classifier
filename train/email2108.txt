Due to an unfortunate mistake this year, I’ve lost all of my GIS data. Portfolios, maps, datasets are all gone! I’m trying to build my portfolio back up, and could use some dataset recommendations. Let me know what your favorite dataset is. It can be ANYTHING. I need to brush up on my mapping and my statistics, so sending anything at all my way would be much appreciated.
