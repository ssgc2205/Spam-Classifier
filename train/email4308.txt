Hi everyone, I am writing a master's thesis in conflict studies and in desperate need of your help. My outcome variable is reconciliation which I intend to proxy with 1. Interracial marriage, or 2. Segregation, or 3. Racial hate crime. I was so far able to find some of these but only in the US or Australia, for example. But what I'm looking for is a cross-country (especially African countries) dataset with these variables. I checked all major I/NGOs but found nothing. Does anyone know where I should look?
