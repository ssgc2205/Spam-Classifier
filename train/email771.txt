Does anyone know of datasets, either from state/national sources (e.g., school systems, federal cops, etc.) or local sources in large cities (e.g., NYC, Los Angeles) that would have some kind of reasonable reports of the kinds of incidents that were reported through lots of personal experiences on Twitter, facebook, etc.? I'm thinking of the reports of verbal harassment, notes left on cars, and possibly even assaults, either directly linked to Trump's win (e.g., the "Now that Trump is president..." incidents) or linked to the purported factors having to do with his win (e.g., racism, sexism, intolerance of LGBTQ+ communities).

In other words, I'm looking for any data that might speak to the question, "Did Trump's election win really cause an uptick in nasty incidents?"
