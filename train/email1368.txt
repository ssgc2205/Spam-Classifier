I spent over a month creating a hand cropped and labeled dataset with 32000 images and 90+ train labels from an 80s Anime. Ultimately my use case had too much error to even be close to useable at that scale (Using [a new deepfake algo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11280) to see if it could translate to animated face replacement), but maybe all of that work could be useful to someone for something simpler (like a character classification).

My question is how strongly does Reddit (and this subreddit) defend Fair Use? The images are from a copyrighted work, but would likely be classified as fair use by any rational person. (1. educational, 3. Low substantiality 4. Possible slightly positive impact on sales).

Also related, if the site won't be overly skiddish, does anyone have good file hosting recommendations for the total file size of 2.7GB (256x256) and 12.6GB (512x512)?
