I'm looking for a data set with the following qualifications:

* 1,000+ rows of data
* over 40+ attributes
* can help solve a "business problem" 
* something where a cost benefit analysis can be done
* Analysis will happen with a decision tree, not regression

&amp;#x200B;

I'll take anything close. I am starting to think these list of qualifications from my professor or too high.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have an idea?  I looked at Kaggle and wasn't able to find anything that fit those qualifications.
