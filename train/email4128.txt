Here are a few of the datasets I've collected over the past year + jupyter notebooks so you can see what's in them!

I collected most of this data to look for product opportunities. Check out the etsy **view count** data and the Google Play **ratings per day** data.

With a bit of analysis you can get a sense of which products are popular and which aren't.

Enjoy!
