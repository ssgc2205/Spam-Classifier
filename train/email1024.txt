Hello reddit world.

I am a doctoral student at a research institution looking for a publicly available dataset. The desired parameters for said dataset is one that has services use outcomes (e.g., mental health treatment, medical treatment, informal treatment, etc) among a population of individuals living with a serious mental illness.  I have looked through ICPSR, SAMHSA and other sites to locate a desirable dataset but no luck...so far. The CPES dataset is of no use to me, since there are too many respondents missing in the services use domain.

Do you have any suggestions of an appropriate dataset?
