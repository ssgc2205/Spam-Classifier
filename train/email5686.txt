To make this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dannellyz/us-flights-with-coivid19-tsa-screening-officer) I partnered with [Airline Data Inc.](https://www.airlinedata.com/the-hub/) which provided their proprietary historic information on all domestic flights within the US from 01MAR-14APR. This was compared against a [list provided publicly by TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus) of all screening officers who tested positive for COVID-19. This dataset is a record of all the flights down-selected by those leaving terminals where these officers worked and had a departure time during their shift.
