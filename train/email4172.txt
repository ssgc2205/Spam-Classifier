I know this data must exist, because I've seen charts of it in [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130) (fig 1), among other publications. It seems like this data is at least available for Hubei. Try as I might, I cannot find the underlying data of this chart â€” I can only find different versions of this same chart. Anyone have any leads?
