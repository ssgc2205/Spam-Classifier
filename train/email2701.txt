Hello,

I collected a dataset containing over 200,000 car offers with 26 variables from one of the largest car advertisement sites in Poland, and I want to share it with you.

I would love to see someone use this data to perform some EDA or car price prediction.

Its my first public dataset and I would greatly appreciate any feedback.
