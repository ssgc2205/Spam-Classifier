Hello,

I am looking for corn use/consumption or demand data (industrial and domestic) for the southeastern states of the US for the past 50-60 years. I looked on USDA NASS but they only have for the nation and only for the past 5-7 years.

Any help including concerning literature or portals, providing historical corn use or demand data will be appreciated.

Thanks
