Hey, so Im taking my first time series class, and as part of a course requirement, we're supposed to look at two time series and check for any relationships between the two. I thought sales and advertisement cost data for a particular product could be two good time series to analyze. Would anyone know any open dataset I could use for the same with atleast 100 data points? Im open to other ideas as well. :) Thanks!
