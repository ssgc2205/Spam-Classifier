Dear fellow Redditors!

My request is probably not best suited for this subreddit but I am really desperate. I have to find a dataset to work with and make somewhat basic analysis. The problem is it has to contain both quantitative and qualitative data for descriptive statistics, anova, regression analysis and contingency. I have found a lot of sources but most of them are either too complicated for the purpose of this assignment or they dont contain either qualitative or quantitative data. Would you have any simple dataset that would fit my needs? Most of the people I asked use some sort of sports stats, but as I dont follow or understand most sports in the depth required for me to also explain the results, I was hoping someone could help me here. Any help is highly appreciated!
