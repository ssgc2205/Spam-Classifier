Hi everyone!

I am working on a system that is able to notify users through multiple channels (push notifications via a mobile application, e-mail, sms, instant messaging, etc). 

I would like to get some insights as to what medium is most favored by customers when sending them a notification. However, insights on channel usage per customer would also be appreciated.

Does anyone know if there are any public datasets related to these topics?

Any help will be much appreciated, thank you!
