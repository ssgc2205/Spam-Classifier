Hello friends!

After a bunch of digging around I found a data set in [data.gov](https://data.gov) that would be absolutely perfect \[[Link - Nielsen: Homescan](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nielsen-homescan)\]. How ever the problem is that the dataset is nonpublic. Is there a dataset that is similar to this one?   


Generally what I am looking for is a time series that is updated weekly or biweekly, tracks the groceries total amount of users of an area, and is around the time of a disaster (like hurricane season in Florida or shortly after a earthquake). 

(bonus points if it contains March or April of this year so it contains the impact of corona virus).

Thank you guys and much love for taking a look at this post &lt;3
