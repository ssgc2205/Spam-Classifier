So I've been working with this one specific dataset that I ran the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of, as I'm trying to figure out the p and q components for an ARIMA model:

Here's what I do know: 

1. This data is heavily seasonal (quarterly)
2. The PACF has spikes at 2,3 and 5. So i'm guessing that p = 2 and seasonal p = 1?
3. The ACF has spikes at 2,4,6,8,10,12 - basically every 2 quarters. I'm guessing q = 2 and seasonal q = 2? 

Please help me out here! This is my first time ever working with ARIMA.
