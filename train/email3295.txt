Hello there,

I am currently trying to write a program that uses all/most raw goods to simulate trading. For something like fruits I'll need information regarding ideal growth conditions and other basic info.

Do you guys know a good source I can get this information from?

Or if you an advice you can share as an experienced person, please share.

Thanks in advance
