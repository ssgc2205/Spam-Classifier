Does anyone know how I could retrieve demographic data for US city council districts?  Is it possible to get this all from census.gov?  

The links below are examples of how I've been collecting the data so far--one city at a time, often in pdf format--slowly an inefficiently.  In each case, however, the source of the cities' demographic data is the census.  

Is there single source or a systematic way I could get this same information for, say, the largest 100 US cities?

Any advice is appreciated!
