Hey guys, probably considered a bit of a silly question here but I am new to this, if i was to create a dataset with multiple outputs, how would this be written.

would I have 24 columns for my 24 outputs? or would I divide 1 by 24 and use each decimal as a new possibility?

for example,

1 0 0 0....

0 1 0 0....

0 0 1 0....

0 0 0 1....

&amp;#x200B;

Or

&amp;#x200B;

0.04

0.08 

0.12

0.16

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
