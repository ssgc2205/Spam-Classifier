Hi. I'm trying to help a friend with her recent makeup store. I was looking for datasets on the makeup market in Brazil, but I was not very successful. Does anyone know any?

I think the most important thing is

&amp;#x200B;

\- Product's name

\- Product type

\- Retail price

\- Wholesale price

\- Region

&amp;#x200B;

But what they have can help me a lot

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much for your attention
