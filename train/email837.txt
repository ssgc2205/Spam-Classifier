I've been pulling data from my University's bus tracking API for the past ~6 months, and I've collected second-by-second interval Long/Lat data for all 25 busses at my school.

The dataset contains the following info: Longitude, latitude, number of students on the bus, destination, speed (not really accurate), bus ID, and timestamp.

We have an extremely inefficient bus system, and the goal of collecting the data was to propose alternative routes that would reduce bus downtime.

What would be the way to visualize this data? I was thinking something like a heat map with Mapbox to visualize the points in which the bus is at rest for long durations of time, but I didn't know if there would be a better way to visualize the inefficiency of the routes that the bus runs on.
