Hello All,

I just got done working over the the ICIJ OffShore Leak Database and need to tell you that it is a treasure trove of corporate and personal identity data. https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/

But... I want more!

Do you know of any other similar kinds of data sets which map relationships between real world people, companies, and places?
