Hey guys,

I'm one of the founders of ParseHub - www.parsehub.com - a visual data extraction tool. We really want to make the world of data accessible to anyone within a few clicks. ParseHub was primarily built to handle javascript and dynamic websites, where getting data from logins, tables, dropdowns, search, pagination, forms, etc. is not a problem.

It would be great if anyone can share their experience with web scraping and checkout out ParseHub for user feedback.

What challenges or hassles did you encounter with web scraping or other methods or data collection?

Have you tried any data extraction tools?

What purpose did you need a large set of data from the web for in the past?

Again, would love to hear your feedback good or bad. Please reach out at angelina@parsehub.com if you want to chat!

:)

Angelina
