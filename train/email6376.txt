Hey!

Just released an other dataset about video game reviews, but this time from a Spanish Website (Vandal)!

This include game titles, website reviews, user reviews, links to the website, release dates and more.

As usual, you can find it here:

 [https://www.kaggle.com/floval/12-000-video-game-reviews-from-vandal](https://www.kaggle.com/floval/12-000-video-game-reviews-from-vandal) 

or here:

I actually have no idea how important (or not?) is this website, I just picked the first Spanish website I saw as I want to use data from different countries for a personal project. Anyway, hopefully it can be useful to someone!
