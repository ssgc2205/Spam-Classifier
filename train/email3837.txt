Does anyone know where it is possible to access data which can be used to calculate expected goals and expected goals against statistics for football (soccer) matches for free? This would include information like the type, position and angle of the shots, ideally going back over multiple seasons.

I'm aware that Opta would be the best and most accurate source for this kind of data, however their prices prevent me from being able to access it. Bloody paywalls.
