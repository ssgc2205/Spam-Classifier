I'd like as comprehensive a list as possible of international events between the US and other nations, in some machine-readable format (e.g., CSV). I'm flexible on what other information is in the dataset, but it should at minimum have the other nation, the year of the incident, and some kind of descriptive label for the incident. I'm most interested in the history between the US and Iran right now, so that by itself would be great. However, a fuller list would be even greater. Time range is flexible, though I hope it would go back to at least the 1960s or 70s.
