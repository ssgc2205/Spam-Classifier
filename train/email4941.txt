Hello all, I have started doing some research in the real estate market and Zillow seems to be the best of the free sources of data. My research is being done on the MSA level and I've noticed that Zillow includes data on a metro level. Would anyone happen to know how they define "metro"? I'm having trouble finding any answers so any explanation on this matter would be greatly appreciated!
