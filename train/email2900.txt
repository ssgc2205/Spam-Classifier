Hi everyone, I'm studying on an undergraduate project about military surveillance system. 

System can be used for the following scenarios:

\- Wide area motion detection

\- Civilian and soldier distinction

\- Monitoring suspicious vehicles/persons

\- Abnormal situation detection and predictions

I'm looking for datasets for these scenarios. Because i think creating my own dataset is a very long process. I'm open for your any advices.

Hope you can help me.
