I planned to build a machine learning models that can read text biographies and extract out certain attributes such as the degree and the industry a person is working in. This is for a postgrad thesis i am working on.

I thought this linkedin dataset would be perfect to train such a model:

Unfortunately, the link is down :( Would anyone have an archival copy of this dataset ? Happy to buy a beer for that kind soul
