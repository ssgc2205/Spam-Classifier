Hello there,

I'm fairly new to the field of research, as a part of my masters degree application they have given me a hypothetical scenario where an organisation needs to conduct a research on  ***how senior citizens type in regional languages on mobile phones .*** I have no clue how and where I can get the data of this kind . What kind of data will it be ?  what shall be my strategy to collect, analyse and validate this data.
