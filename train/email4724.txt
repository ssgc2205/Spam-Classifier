Need help finding zip-code level time-series (preferably daily) data on Covid-19 cases in the US.

NYC data available here: [https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-covid-19-tests-by-zipcode-time-series](https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-covid-19-tests-by-zipcode-time-series)

Need a similar dataset for the rest of the US. Any leads would be appreciated! Thanks

Edit: Any quick way to scrape daily data at Zip code level (for earlier dates as well) would also be appreciated
