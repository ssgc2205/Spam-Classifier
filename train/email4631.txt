Looking for a data set which lists Chinese births, including the age of the mother at the time of birth. I'm new to the subreddit, so if this submission is incorrectly formatted, please let me know; I'd be happy to revise and resubmit. 

I'm also new to searching for data in any capacity, so if there are any general tips, I would also appreciate it. Thank you!
