Hello friends,

I need help. I am currently using Europeam Values Study data set (2017) and i did crosstab for two variables - country code and political party support.

The problem is that i have been given all the countries and all the political parties.

I would like to sort varibles in a way that i see only a specific country and the support for the political parties only in that country.

Thank you im advance
