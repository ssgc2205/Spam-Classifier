Hi everyone,  
I'm wondering if something like this exists or if there's a tool I could use to closely approximate the experience of it. I want an iOS app that allows me to quickly time activities of different types and push the data in a very simple format to my computer when I want it.   
The experience I'm imagining is something like, I wake up and hit the wake up button. The app records when I woke up on this day. I go to brush my teeth and hit the "start brushing teeth" button, then the "stop brushing teeth" button when I'm done, and the app records when I started and stopped brushing my teeth on this day. Rinse and repeat this experience for things like eating meals, urinating, commuting, shopping, etc. I'd also like if some activities had other options added to them as well, like when I hit the "stop grocery shopping button" I add the amount of money that I spent on groceries or likewise for when I'm done eating out or something like that. Again, I'd also really like if the data were either remotely or manually pushed to my computer and separated by day so that months from now I can look at shit-tons of correlations and stuff.  
Does anyone know if anything like this exists?  
Thanks!
