Hey all. I'm looking for a dataset where I can find annual number of tourists per state. Something like below:

|State|Number of Visitor in 2019|
|:-|:-|
|Nevada|3,000,000|
|New York|6,000,000|

Does anyone know where I can find such dataset? If it's by city, that's fine, too.

I thought I could find such dataset through a quick Google search, but it's a lot more elusive than I thought so asking for help here...
