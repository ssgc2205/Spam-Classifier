When looking at images there are common sets of usage rights, Free, Non commercial and non-commercial attributed usage, etc. Are there similar sorts of usage rights for public data sets and feeds?

I'm aware of: 


Free
Freemium (API usage restrictions)
With Attribution
Paid For

But are there common usage restrictions or licences to back up these models?
