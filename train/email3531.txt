Are there any other sources for Weather data? I'm looking basically for the day's high, low, and any precipitation. I'd like to get data for all 50 State capitals in the US, and as early into the 1900s as much as possible. 

I've been trying to export the data from NOAA search tool, but the past couple of .csv files I've downloaded don't have any values for TMin and TMax.
