I've been chatting with my discord community for aspiring/current data analysts and there seems to be an interest in adding project work on their resume, so here it is.

Are interested in a guided data analytics consulting project? It's also a great opportunity for current analysts to develop management skills. Apply through [here](https://0rmeoplobmw.typeform.com/to/TfA2ARVt):

What’s required?

* 4-8hrs a week for 3 weeks depending how many people are on the team.
* Positive and fun attitude to solving problems with data!

What to expect:

* Safe space in data analytics consultation (I’m your client).
* Freedom to solve problems with external data.
* Work in a team of 3-5 with a team leader.
* Meetings, research, Excel, SQL, Tableau and presentation and deadlines.
* Starting early March.
* Fun and real environment such as filling in timesheets and budgeting with fake currency.

What will you get out of this?

* Project experience that will boost your resume appeal and feel like a data analyst during your interviews.
* Range of technical skills exposure for the real world and improving your soft skills.
* Feedback on improvements and what you did well.

Is this free? No. It will cost you some surveys and a retro session.
