Hi everyone,

I am new to machine learning and I'm looking for a dataset that will allow me to predict the human core body temperature (preferably from the skin temperature) but I can't find any related dataset.

Could anyone please link me to a dataset or suggest me an alternative method to solve this problem?

Any help is appreciated, Thank you.

P.S: I already tried searching on Kaggle and Google dataset but I had no luck.
