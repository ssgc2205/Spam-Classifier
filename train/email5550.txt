Hi! I'm new to the sub, so feel free to alert me to any rule-breaking behavior.

I'm doing research for my uni and I'm looking for a dataset that contains a list of accounts labeled as either an organization, a bot, or an individual. I couldn't find much online despite there being a few papers on the subject.

Thanks for the help.
