Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to start conducting some research for my thesis on the topic of fake news in Brazil. A lot of this fake news is sent through WhatsApp, but I highly doubt there are datasets out there to analyse these messages. It is very unlikely but if they do exist, could someone put me in the right direction? 

Alternatively, are there are sites for compiled datasets/archives of facebook comment/post/groups data?

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks for taking the time to read this specific question!
