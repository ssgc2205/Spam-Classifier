Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to map a set of 20K zip codes to the nearest major city. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have Zip code to MSA but there's over 200+ MSAs and that's too granular for our analysis. Counties also proved to be too numerous.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to set that ties zip codes to a larger footprint than MSA region but smaller than state? 

Thank you!
