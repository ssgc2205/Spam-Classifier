I have been working on this project for a few months now where I have merged coronavirus data of the world from various datasets. The problem is that my [source](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv) of \`total\_recovered\` feature has [stopped reporting](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/3464) recoveries for US since December.

This makes my graph look like this.

I have been unable to find the data from any other source. Is my best bet now to just discard this feature now?
