I'm looking for a more extensive/similar version [to this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yersever/500-person-gender-height-weight-bodymassindex). Sadly it only has 500 rows which isn't enough from the prediction test I just did.

Anything along the lines of

* Height
* Weight
* Health
* Age
* Gender
* Ethnicity
* BMI

etc

is welcome
