I am trying to download and open the  [CPS 2000 30-day Food Security Supplement Data File: Data](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/50764/26552_fs00xtra.zip?v=0) from the URL link below and when it downloads on my computer I have no idea how to open it or import it into Excel or Stata so that it is actually usable. I don't have any experience with using data sets, and I'm unsure of what to do with the DAT file that it comes in. Any help is incredibly appreciated!!
