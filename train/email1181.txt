Looking for a rich source of data for analysis on current 6 nations players. Any data on the 6 Nations championships itself is welcome, as well as any source on the Domestic rubgy tournaments, e.g. Pro 12, Champions cup, Top 14. Looking in particular for match statistics for each player. This includes simple stats (Tries scored, red/yellow cards) and more in-depth stats (metres made, defenders beaten). Any help at all would be great!
