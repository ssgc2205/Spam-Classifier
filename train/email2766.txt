Hi,

I'm looking to collect data on the maximum duration of unemployment insurance benefits for each state, from 1967 to today. I'm hoping someone could point me in the right direction on the DOLETA [website](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/DataDashboard.asp) of where I might find that data. So far I think it is in the ETA 218 or 5159 on [the data downloads tab](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/DataDownloads.asp), but I'm not certain. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
