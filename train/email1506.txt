Hello r/datasets!

I'm looking for a dataset of English idiomatic expressions along with their definitions/meanings, e.g., "let the cat out of the bag" -- to reveal a secret, usually accidentally. A dataset grouping the idioms by semantic categories (animals, sports, music, etc.) would be even more useful. Any help is highly appreciated!
