I am writing a research paper on the economic impact of the manufacture of certain items and I have chosen a violin bow. Something that seemingly is not very impactful but has many parts from many different places and has had some pretty drastic changes made to it over the years (ex. Ivory to ebony frog). I am looking for statistics like how much Pernambuco wood is purchased from Brazil for the making of violin bows and how much ivory was exported for bows before the ban? I have no idea where to look and have googled everything I can think of. Iâ€™m probably not thinking of something obvious but I need help. Thanks  :)
