I am looking for a data set with, say, the 5000 most used German nouns with their respective articles for the purpose of creating an Anki deck.

The decks that I have found (e.g. these [https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/artikel](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/artikel)) have too few words and also I would like to practice creating Anki decks automatically.
