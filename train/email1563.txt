I'm teaching a machine learning course, and have been using synthetic data for most of my examples. I'd love to have simple datasets from the real world to use for demonstrations in class. Ideally n &lt; 30, one binary variable, 2-3 continuous variables that explain most of the binary variable. 

One example I've used for univariate binary data is the Shuttle O-Ring failure, but I'd like something with at least one more covariate.
