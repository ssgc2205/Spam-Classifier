Hello,

 What's Flat Data?

&gt; Flat explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub. 
&gt; It builds on the "git scraping" approach pioneered by Simon Willison 
&gt; to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories 
&gt; and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and 
&gt; easier than working with data over the wire.

  For a long running real-world example following the flat data "git scraping" approach
  even before Simon Willison pioneered the approach 
  allow me to highlight the [/factbook.json](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.json) datasets.

  The 260 country profile datasets get auto-updated twice a month (on the 1st and 15th)
  via the [/factbook](https://github.com/factbook/factbook) scripts
 for easy (re)use and offline world data exploration.

  What's your take on Flat Data?
 Do you know (or use) any datasets via git and GitHub?
