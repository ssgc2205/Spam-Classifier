Hi,
I'm not having much luck with finding historical data of the weather on the Shetland Islands. I am doing a mapping of the southern tip of the islands with focus on wind/sun/rain etc.
Anything weather related is great, as I have not settled on which area I'll focus on yet, as I can't find enough data. 
So if you have any information you could pass my way, it is greatly appreciated.
