I assume someone somewhere has put this together. Has anyone looked at the death rate of those who have no comorbidities by age group? I would want to also know if COVID was the primary cause of death. To find the death rate, maybe this data would need to assume the total infected using official estimates plus estimates from new studies that may be indicating more people have been exposed than originally thought. This would be extremely interesting.
