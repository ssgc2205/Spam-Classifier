Hello frens,

&amp;#x200B;

I published on kaggle a dataset of 3200 fundus images for the purpose of classfication of 46 different labels (retinal diseases). It has both common diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, etc as well as rarer ones for a more realistic representation of clinical settings.

&amp;#x200B;

It is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/retinal-disease-classification).
