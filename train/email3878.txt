Hi All, 

I'm experimenting with building an application that would utilize historical metadata on classical tracks. Specifically, the place and time a particular piece was first performed. Example unit of data:

* Composer: Ludwig van Beethoven
* Title: Symphony No. 5
* First Performed:
 * Nation: Austria
 * City: Vienna
 * Year: 1808

This information can usually be found by manually reading Wikipedia, but I was hoping there was something more easily programatically accessible out there. Thanks in advance for any leads!
