Hello everyone! I am currently in the final leg of my MSc in Economics programme at the University of Amsterdam. For my thesis, I want to analyze whether airline alliances are truly beneficial for consumers by looking at the effects of alliances on prices, own quality (and maybe environmental impact). At the moment, I am still looking for data. I have already found data on the US market from the USDOT, but I am more interested in the EU market. 

Where could I find data on any of the following:

* on air ticket fares on flights starting from European airports
* flights between European airports per airlines with details 
* airline quality 
* environment impact of airlines
