Hey, I'm performing a study of factors that were determining the amount of protestors in Moscow from 2013 to 2020, but I couldn't find any datasets with relevant data. I've found datasets with the amount of detentions by OVD-info, but that's not particularly what I needed. There is also the "White counter" Twitter, but manually importing data from there to .csv would be hell. Does anyone have datasets for that topic? Time bounds are not strict, like data for 2011-2018 would also be great
