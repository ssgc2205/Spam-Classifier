I'm going to be constructing labeled datasets that are for creating models to assess whether or not a statement represents curiosity or not. I'm going to use pro-science tweets as a proxy for curiosity. So I would like some suggested twitter feeds that are pro science as well as some that are anti-science. I was thinking NASA would be a great start to represent curiosity and pro-science.
