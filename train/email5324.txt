I apologize if I'm ignorant with respect to this. Hence why I'm asking. I was wondering where these guys are getting their data, originally. Like how do PIs find who a car belongs to? I'm presuming from FOIA requests or some similar mechanism to various state DMVs. If so, why isn't there a public version? Can I just...file a FOIA request to the DMV and ask them for the data? Of course, anonymized.
