I have been looking for sites to either webscrape this data or find any csv files, etc. I am new to searching for datasets and working with data in general. Would love some guidance on if there are popular **FREE** sites to get this sort of data from. After reading lots of random financial articles, I found this [site](https://www.usabledatabases.com/database/atm-locations-in-us/) \- but I do not want to pay $50 for it. 

Any help would be truly appreciated
