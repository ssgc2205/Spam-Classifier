I'm looking to find data to use to practice my survival analysis techniques. I'd make up numbers, but most of the time this leads to something totally skewed, absolutely not significant, or EXTREMELY related to the point of it being impossible.

Are there any data bases I can quickly get a .csv for survival analysis?
