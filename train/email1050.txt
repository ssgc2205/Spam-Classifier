Does anyone know of an English language dictionary dataset where words are assigned category labels?

Specifically, e.g., it would be great if "running" and "walking" were labelled as "action" or "action verb", whereas, "talking" and "shouting" were labelled as "communication" or "communication verb".

Thanks!
