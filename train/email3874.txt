so Im looking for a dataset with data from **Primary , Secondary &amp; Tertiary Sales , and Marketing Data (ATL, BTL &amp; TTL)** for a company along with its competitor data (for relative measures). Something like from Canadean for primary, Dist to store level from the CRM and Nielsen (pos) for tertiary.

Its almost impossible that I'll find an open dataset with all that info, but, just testing my luck. would be great if someone could point me in the right direction.

edit: 

so the closest thing I found is the [AdventureWorks](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) dataset from Microsoft. here are the [Description document](https://www.devart.com/samples/documenter-for-sql-server/AdventureWorks2016-doc.pdf) and [schema](https://blog.sqlauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Adventureworks-800x496.jpg)
