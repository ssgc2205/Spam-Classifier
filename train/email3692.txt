I am currently trying to compare the total time every nuclear reactor has ben active (performing fission) in total to the number of nuclear related accidents and the number of people that died or where harmed in said accidents.

It is the former statistic that i am currently struggling to acquire, I therefor inquire as to whether any one on this fine subreddit would be in possession of such statistics or be able to inform me as to where i might be able to obtain said statistics?
