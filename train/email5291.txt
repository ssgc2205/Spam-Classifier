My former college (Truman State University) is cutting two sports programs (wrestling and men's tennis) due to budget constraints. The kicker is the wrestling program is self-funded... 

I would like to get the athletic departments financial statements to perform some cost analysis, etc.

Is there anywhere I can locate it? Or should I just send an email to the administration asking for it?
