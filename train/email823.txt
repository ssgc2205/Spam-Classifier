I'm working as a GA for a prof who has tasked me with locating a dataset he can use for his research. The prof studies cross-cultural marketing and the dataset just needs to be about general consumer behavior (very wide open, ex: recycling behavior, purchasing behavior, etc…) that has location as an independent variable. 

Importantly, he has to purchase the data (nothing free) because he needs to spend his budget, but he’d like to be able to get a refund or purchase on a trial basis to ensure the data will be useful for his research. Any tips? I feel like I've exhausted my web searching abilities.

Thank you in advance!
