So first of all, this is likely not the right place for this and if that is the case somebody pointing me there would be greatly appreciated.

I'm looking for a place to get some simple statistics on the entirety of the human population of earth. Specifically eye, skin and hair color. My most thorough googling hasn't given anything with real value, but i would assume the figures exist somewhere.

I'ts just for a casual hobby thing so it doesn't have to be very accurate.
