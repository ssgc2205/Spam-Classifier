I do commercial real estate and trying to find the best raw comprehensive list of all self storage and boat and rv storage businesses in the USA (address, business/entity name, county, etc). I’ve used countless list brokers, who I’ve heard gather all their data from the same place, acxiom. Not sure if this is true but if you have any suggestions on who keeps the most comprehensive list of all businesses in the US I would be grateful for some direction. Thanks!
