Hello I'm working on a research project to forecast flooding (and possibly other weather events in the future as well) using machine learning. I used to use the Wunderground API however that was discontinued 1/19. I'm looking for another cheap (less than $20 month) or entirely free service where I can get hourly precipitation data (both historical and current). I'm aware of NOAA however that data only seems to go up to 2012 and is incredibly sparse (tons of missing values). Other sites like OpenWeather want to charge $150/month for historical data which seems ridiculous. Anyone aware of alternatives? I'm planning on open-sourcing my code/dataset as a benchmark once finished for anyone else interested in tackling this problem.

Also if anyone knows of a place to get hourly (or even daily) snow depth data at a specific lat/lon that would be incredibly helpful for forecasting some of the mountain fed streams.
