I am looking for a freely (as in beer) available dataset about ETF and Investment funds.

I don't need very granular data, just the year-over-year performance for the last 2 periods will be sufficient.

I've tried looking in Morningstar but there's no download available...

Also regulators have some data about it in PDF format because the laws says ETF and fund managers must report periodically...

...but I can't see a CSV file or similar available.

Any idea about how to find it?
