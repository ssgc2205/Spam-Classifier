I've been trying to find location data on any/all of the [solar system probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_Solar_System_probes) for two days and haven't had any luck. It really seems like the best place to get such data (at least for NASA probes) would be from [NASA's open data catalog](https://data.nasa.gov/). I've tried searching the catalog by the names of these probes and any of the resulting data seems very specific to particular projects...I'm really just trying to find the most recent location data for any of the probes. Is it unrealistic for me to expect to find such data?
