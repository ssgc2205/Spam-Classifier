I am trying to analyze the financial/revenue data and understand how this pandemic impacted the supply chain for a few industries eg., textile manufacturing where the demand has been floored and supply has also gone down with closing industries for a while. But for the industries that produce PPE and other medical equipment, the demand skyrocketed.
