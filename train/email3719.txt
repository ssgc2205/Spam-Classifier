Hello all!

I would like to ask if anyone knows any data set publicly available, which is a good case for a data integration exercise. Ideally I would like something that exists in more than one formats in any domain.  
For example in tourism industry we may have a dataset with the Hotels in Germany provided in a csv file and the hotels in Italy provided via an API.  
The idea is, that the participant will get the datasets from their respective sources, unify and prepare them for some data science tasks (e.g descriptive analytics).  
Thank you!
