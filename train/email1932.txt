Looking to find a set of data of used car pricing across the market. Ideally, I would like to have something that contained historical prices that used cars were listed for. I would like to do some a analysis on the trends of depreciation of vehicles. Any help or direction would be appreciated. 

Does Autotrader or Craigslist have an API that allows that kind of access?
