I'm very aggressively learning my way through R programming before the start of the next academic year. I've been reading several books and tutorials but I'd like to put it into practice. I have always wanted to make some comparison between salary and various personal attributes. Perhaps someone knows of a dataset (even a small one) which could be used for this purpose. Any attributes are fine but I would particularly like height as many articles keep talking about how many CEOs are over a certain height or "how an extra inch taller is worth so much per year" but I am struggling to find their data sources. Thanks in advance.
