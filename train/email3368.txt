Hi guys and gals.

Been getting a sponsored ad on my Facebook feed for Infograpia--a slideset that provides 1500+ editable infographics compatible with Google Slides, Keynote, and Microsoft PowerPoint. All-time access is at $49.

Have any of you used Infograpia? If so, is it worth having? My job as a digital marketing analyst kinda requires me to deal with a lot of data viz, that's why I looked into Infograpia.

Thanks for your thoughts!
