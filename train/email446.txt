Hi,

Question: What software/web browser/web page do you use to get macroeconomic data? How would you search for more complicated data? I am mainly focused on US data but there are some things that I could not find on [https://www.fedsearch.org](https://www.fedsearch.org/) and [https://search.bea.gov/](https://search.bea.gov/) usually they direct you to articles instead of charts.

I don't usually write on Reddit, but I think, after wasting so much time trying to get the information on my own and not getting anywhere I think it's time to ask for help. I'm working on a final project for my University Degree and  I would like to check, what I am reading actually is true looking at the charts. Sometimes the writers don't specify whether they are talking about nominal or real values and things like that. Even though I can get some of that information if I look extensively, I will spend most of my time checking facts rather than reading about them. And some charts I couldn't even get, for example, the purchase of US bonds of the Japanese Government throughout history. I have a friend that has access to the Bloomberg Terminal but I don't want to bother him every day.
