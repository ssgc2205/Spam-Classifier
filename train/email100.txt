Hello all,

I am looking for any data by detailed occupation ideally grouped by how someone would study for the occupation (lawyer, engineer, builder, electrician, pharmacist, primary school teacher, economist) but absolutely not fussy. 

This is all for a project where I am trying to see what the different outcomes are for different career paths. Its been quite a nightmare to find any datasets like this so any help is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance.
