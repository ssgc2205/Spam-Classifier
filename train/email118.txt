Hi r/datasets,

I am working on a research to cluster Asian languages based on just the numerals of the language. I searched and could not find databases of some languages. If anyone has an idea where I can find the handwritten numeral dataset? TIA

* Thai
* Malayalam
* Burmese
* Gujarati
* Chinese
* Japanese
* Tamil
