Hi all, 

I am gathering data for my thesis on commercial real estate. In particular, I am studying the effect of Energy Star and LEED certifications on office rental and vacancy rates in major metro markets. Where would a good place be to find data on this? I have used CoStar in the past for a company but no longer have access and I'm too poor to pay the $1,000 monthly subscription lol.
