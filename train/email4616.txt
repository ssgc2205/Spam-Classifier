Trying to find an up to date dataset for suicide (including 2020/ covid/ lockdown times for obvious reasons, please wear a goddamn mask guys). The best I can find is 2017 ish.

I'm relatively new to "data science" broadly as well. So if someone could give me some pointers for getting raw data from the CDC please lmk.
