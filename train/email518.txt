Currently helping out a friend with a little research project and we need a dataset regarding religion (the more the marrier) by country (every single country, if the US is separated by states there that would be helpful too). And preferably something newer (2020 would be awesome but I know it's hard). And naturally, we are here since we don't want to pay 5K for 1 week of access (I can't believe people put those kinds of prices on data O.o)
