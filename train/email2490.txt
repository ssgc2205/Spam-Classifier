Does anyone have or know where to find massive data sets pertaining to either chemical bulk shipping and or mining of metals? 

Or possibly any massive data sets in excel using formulas? 

I want to develop a program that takes data sets from excel workbooks including formula and relations (links to other sheets) and converts and parses it into a useable relational database. Looking for data sets I can use for testing and development. Prefer data in either chemical shipping or metal mining.
