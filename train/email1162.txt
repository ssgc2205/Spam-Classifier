Hi all, I am currently working on a paper about the effect of economic crises on the demand for cinema industry in Turkey. Does anyone have a dataset for film consumption? Especially genre data is so hard to find. Other countries datas will also be beneficial for comparison. The dependent variable is the number of tickets and our independent variables are budget, award nomination, critic, genre, sequel, production company etc. Thanks in advance.
