I'm working on a project that requires bank statements or similar - the kind any consumer gets monthly from their bank. 

While searching, I see a bunch out there, (Kaggle, etc.) but these are transactions in csv. I need something that looks like actual PDF version. It doesn't have to be real customer info, just the format, so we can train and test. 

Have you seen around? Thanks in advance.
