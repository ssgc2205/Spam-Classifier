Does anyone know the sources for raw data?

I  found a few websites that visualize the data, but can't find any raw  data sets. I even tried looking at network calls in Chrome devtools to  see if the sites are querying an api endpoint for the data. I am really  surprised there is not more interest for this in this reddit and [r/dataisbeatiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeatiful/)
