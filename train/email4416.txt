I've noticed that it's become quite difficult to find a good open dataset for real-estate data.  Mainly the features I'm looking for are:

* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Amount of space (square feet / square meters)
* Price (total or rent would be fine)

Anything else would be bonus.  Any recommendations appreciated!  Thanks!
