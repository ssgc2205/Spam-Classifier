I am beginning to take interest in data science and have looked over a few datasets from various sources but I am not sure whether I am doing it right. What is your preferred workflow? Is it, download file -&gt; import into a DB (which one?) and then use some sort of tool to analyze it? Also what are some useful analysis algorithms to run on numerical data? other than finding the mean, min, max, etc.. And last, how do you deal with geo data?
