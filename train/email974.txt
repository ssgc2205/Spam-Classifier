So i'm looking for datasets and I'd found this one from University of Maryland but upon downloading it, I had to agree to this : 

'Licensee agrees NOT to: -Publicly post or display any part of GTD without express written permission by Licensor other than quoting the GTD in Licenseeâ€™s reports, papers, or analyses'

So if I was to do any work on this I couldn't publish anything nor add it to my resume, right ?
