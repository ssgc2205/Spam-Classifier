I have a class project and my group is trying to find ways to reduce the number of returns for online orders. I'm running the survey for another day,  and want to try and get another 50 takers or so. After I finish the project In about a week I'll post the raw data set that I acquire in a spreadsheet form.

If you have about 3-5 minutes, heres [the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OXcGgaN8PURHSqAEjrpNF48Ps1vXa0h65-bzc8yJ0bg/viewform?usp=send_form).
