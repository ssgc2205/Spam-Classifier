 I have a database of mutual fund data: month, fund id, return of fund; fund flow and stock holdings(price, number of shares, beta of shares). The data is quarterly provided (I have a quarter id allocated) however the delta is monthly. Now I need to classify the funds into 5 quintiles in Stata based on the beta of the shares they hold, and these 5 portfolios have to be equally weighted, so not considering the market cap of shares. How can I do this in Stata ?
