I want to create forecasting model for future in-demand skills (I am still deciding between python and R). In the first step I would like to collect some data. My initial idea was to get the data about job postings for last 5+ years and based on that I would start my analysis. First I was hoping that I would manage to get it with webscraping of linkedin posts but I found out that job postings are deleted after the company find their candidate. Do you guys have any suggestion where and how could I collect similar data? Does somebody know a dataset that matches these requirements, that is available for free? Would any of you try some other approach to achieve the same forecasting model? Any thoughts would be highly appreciated!
