Do you know of any publicly available datasets from industrial equipment? 

I have worked on several projects, but the data is always proprietary so it's hard to share the results.

I'm looking for data to use for applications of machine learning to industrial machine &amp; equipment health? Ex. Using sensor data to train a model to classify failure modes or predict remaining useful life.

I have found several hyped up marketing pieces, but very few real-world examples.... even fewer where the dataset has been made public so that you can repeat their results.

Here are the best two papers I've come across... Know of anything similar?
