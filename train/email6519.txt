Hello!

I am looking for a dataset on job interviews. It can be of any medium (e.g. phone, online, face-to-face interviews) as long as its a 1-on-1 interview between the interviewer and the interviewee. If the dataset has two languages in it (i.e. the interviewee speaks bilingually), then it is highly appreciated, although it is optional.

Currently, I am taking an undergraduate thesis and I have emailed some companies and organizations that can provide me with data, but some were not responding and some said that they were not publicly available. 

Thank you and any response is appreciated!
