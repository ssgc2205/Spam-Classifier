Hey there, I'm trying to download or otherwise get my hands on the CDC's BRFSS data set for 2019. Its not available for download as an R file. I tried downloading it as a SAS and SPSS file and converting, but I'm not having luck for some reason. Anyone have any pointersâ€”or simply the file itself?

Thanks!
