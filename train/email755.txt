Hey all,

I'm looking to find some data on math assessments in the K-12 range. I'm not looking for school statistics or state passing rates or anything like that. I'm looking for how students are answering specific questions, what problems students get wrong, what problems they get right, etc. Is there any data out there which contains actual student information with specific math problems?
