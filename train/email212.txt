The [ICDAR 2017 site](http://u-pat.org/ICDAR2017/program_competitions.php) redirects me [to this site](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/ICDAR2017_PODCompetition/index.html), which has been offline for at least a month. In fact, Beijing University's Content Protection and Document Processing Lab, has also deleted (or possibly restricted its access to China) its other dataset for page object detection, [Marmot](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/data/marmot_data.htm) (which would also be useful for me). Given that these two datasets are used in many document analysis papers, I hope for the off chance that someone here has a copy. Thanks in advance.
