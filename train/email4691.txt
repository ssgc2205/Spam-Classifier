Hello everyone, 

I am working on a project to identify abnormal vital signs and perhaps link them to certain diseases.

I have a good dataset for people with medical conditions \[abnormal\] which I thought is the hardest part, but so far I haven't found any good dataset for healthy people dataset.

I am looking for \[Blood Pressure - Respiratory Rate - Temperature - Heart Rate\] dataset for healthy people or labelled normal.

Any recommendations is highly appreciated, thanks guys!
