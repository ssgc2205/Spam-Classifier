I am trying to drop cases where the comment body text is just "TRUE", but it doesn't get dropped with my current code. I am able to drop cases that say "\[deleted\]" or "\[removed\]", but not "TRUE". Does anyone know what these "TRUE" comment's are? Or why I cannot just drop them? Thanks for any help!! Below is my code!

\---------------------------------------

\#declare where the output directory is

outdir = "C:/Users/jms21/TrackPaper-Reddit/BigQuery"

\#declare where the input directory is

indir = "C:\\\\Users\\\\jms21\\\\TrackPaper-Reddit\\\\BigQuery\\\\Comments"

\##JOIN ALL CSV FILES INTO ONE SINGLE CSV FILE

&amp;#x200B;

\#Create a function to join all the csv files in a folder into one csv file

&amp;#x200B;

\#Create the function, name the directory where the csv files are, and what the output file is

def join\_csv(indir = "C:\\\\Users\\\\jms21\\\\TrackPaper-Reddit\\\\BigQuery\\\\Comments", outfile = "C:\\\\Users\\\\jms21\\\\TrackPaper-Reddit\\\\BigQuery\\\\Single\_File.csv"):

	

	\#delete 'Single\_File.csv' if it already exists to avoid making more copies

	os.chdir(outdir)

	try:

		os.remove('Single\_File.csv')

	except OSError:

		pass

	\#make sure 'Single\_File.csv' no longer exists

	if os.path.isfile(outfile):

		print ("ERROR: 'Single\_File.csv' still exists.")

	else:

		print ("PROCEED: 'Single\_File.csv' does not exist.")

		

	\#change to the directory where the csv files are

	os.chdir(indir)

	\#put all the csv files into a list of files to put into the joining function

	fileList = glob.glob('\*.csv')

	\#define the total list

	dfList = \[\]

	\#add all the csv files to the total list

	for filename in fileList:

\#		print(filename)

		df = pd.read\_csv(filename)

		print(filename, df\['subreddit'\].unique())

		dfList.append(df)

	\#join the csv files into one file, 'axis = 0' means it will join them by vertical columns

	concatDf = pd.concat(dfList, axis = 0)

	\#return the created panda/list to a single csv file output (location and name already defined above)

	concatDf.to\_csv(outfile)

	

\#call the function	

join\_csv()

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\#read Single\_File.csv into a dataframe

data = pd.read\_csv('Single\_File.csv')

&amp;#x200B;

\#remove all cases that say \[deleted\], \[removed\], and TRUE in the body

data = data.set\_index("body")

data = data.drop("\[deleted\]", axis = 0)

data = data.drop("\[removed\]", axis = 0) 

data = data.drop("TRUE", axis = 0) 

data = data.reset\_index()

data = data.drop(\['Unnamed: 0'\], axis = 1)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\#Clean the dataframe

data\['body'\] = data\['body'\].str.lower()

data\['body'\] = data\['body'\].str.replace('/',' ')

data\['body'\] = data\['body'\].str.replace('\[\^\\w\\s\]','')

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

pd.DataFrame(data).to\_csv("Data.csv")
