Hi There,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in my first semester of a Master's of Science in Business Analytics program at a university in Massachusetts.  I have been assigned a project in my Data Mining course where I am expected to present a business problem and how I would solve this problem.  I was hoping to find something that I am interested in and not some boring dataset through Kaggle that I have no connection to.  Ultimately, I would like to find something connected to the success of Starbucks but I have fallen short.  Is there anyone out there that could lead me in the right direction?  I would like to find a useful dataset in Starbucks, Dunkin's, Tim Horton's, etc..  I have an interest in coffee since it's a passion of mine, but also something that seems like a booming industry.  I am interested in many other avenues so if you feel like you have something worthwhile, please post, this is just something that I thought would be plentiful!
