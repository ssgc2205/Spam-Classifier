Hi,

[Gwern published a collection of Darknet Market Archives in 2015](https://www.gwern.net/DNM-archives). While the dataset is comprehensive, a lot of works need to be done before we can start analyzing it. I put some effort to organize Gwern's archives, extract only drug-related content, and construct a drug listing dataset in csv format.
