 I'm new to machine learning. I wanted to use Linear Regression with Python to predict end of semester grades using the student's previous year grades. For example, I wanted to predict a student's Grade 12 results using their Grade 10 &amp; 11 marks. I've looked at Kaggle and some sites on Google but haven't been able to find what I'm looking for. Any sources that might have enough data (class 10, 11, 12 grades / class 12 semester wise grades, etc.) would be greatly appreciated. I have a little experience with web scraping so even websites that might contain student profiles and marks will be amazing. Thanks a bunch for the help :D
