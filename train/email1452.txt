 

Hello All,

I hope you can help me out here. I am looking for some sort of data set for the assessment test for newly appointed IT Analyst that we will interview on Friday.  
We would like to ask them to complete some data analysis and present the result. This would test their Excel Skills like vlookups, pivottable, formulas, creating charts

I could prepare something from my WMS but one of the candidates is internal and that would be unfair for the rest applicants.

Do you have something you can share that you used before or any idea what this could be?

Thanks
