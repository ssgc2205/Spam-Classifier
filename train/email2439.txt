I'm stuck on this issue for a week now. There is no clear taxanomy available on the internet. Let me elaborate a bit, I'm looking to classify shoes in 4 categories - Ankle, Calf, Knee Length and Over The Knee. I have scraped my own data, and used some available datasets, but none of them have a clear differentiation between the data. There is a lot of overlap between the classes (eg high ankle is lower calf in some cases, a shoe in calf length is knee length in many cases). Is there any dataset available in this case or do I have to gather more and more images? I know height is subjective to different vendors, but there must be some sort of middle ground somewhere. Any kind of help is appreciated.
