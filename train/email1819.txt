I'm looking for ideas of personal data points I can collect about myself. Here's what I currently collect-

- MyFitnessPal food intake
- Fitbit step/heartrate info
- Moment phone usage
- Habit tracking using DO iOS app
- Spotify tracking using LastFM
- Browsing habits using Chrome/Safari History
- Mint financial habits

I'm interested in any other cool ideas you all have for personal data. A summer project I might work on is using a few API's and building a program that will bring all my data together and visualize it somehow.

TLDR: What personal data points do you collect about yourself and how do you collect them? 

If you have any questions about gathering data points I detailed above I'll answer your questions!
