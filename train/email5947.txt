Hello guys, I am a final year CSE undergrad. I am are pursuing a research project in the field of Personality Analysis using Twitter data. I am currently looking for a dataset to continue my research. I would very much appreciate it if anyone could share the Open data repository that available or if there are any other alternatives for the data sources that you are aware of. My exact requirement is a dataset containing both tweets as well as Big 5 personality answers from those users.
