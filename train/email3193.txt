I'm developing a free app, currently with no ads, and I need some way to monetize it.
I thought about selling datasets of anonymous usage statistics (assuming its user base will grow), are there companies who wish to buy such datasets usually ? how much is it worth ?

(Without getting into too much details, the app allows people to listen to new music)

Thanks everyone for your help
