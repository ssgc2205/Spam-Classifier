Hi,

I am trying to build an end to end machine learning project. I am looking for a dataset for a regression or classification use case where I could ingest new data every day or every hour (preferably using an API).

I am looking for an use case that could be related to business/marketing purposes.

Do you have any ideas on which publicly available datasets I could use?

Thank you very much!
