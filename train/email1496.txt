After reading [this](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/) analysis of PINs, I have decided that I'd like to give it a go for myself but I'm unsure of where to get such data. The article vaguely refers to "security breaches" and "exposed password tables" although as I'm not involved in the more nefarious side of coding I don't know how I would attain such things. I was wondering if anyone knew of a dataset or text-file that just contained a large number of PINs, no other data required.
