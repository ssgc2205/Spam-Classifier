Hello everyone, I'm wishing to research about fertility intentions and family planning before and after the Arab Spring in countries that have experienced it. Therefore, I am looking for a dataset that has at least two waves (before and after 2012) and that has been collected in at least two of the following countries: Tunisia, Iran, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, Lybia, Syria, Kuwait, Algeria, Oman, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia. Do you know any sources I could use?  Thank you :)
