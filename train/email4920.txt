I am involved in a campaign in my city that has allowed me to spend time with several of the key figures. I talk with politicians, councillors, urban planners, developers and local business leaders and I always ask them what data they are collecting and what they are using it for. 

Local authorities say that they are collecting data and that it's published on their website, but what they're always referring to is pdf reports that contain some statistics.

I want to hear examples of cities that are collecting and using data effectively so I can start working to improve how my city does it.
