Don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm doing history/historical geography research on homesteading in the early 20th century, and I wanted to do some quantitative analysis of homestead patents in Oregon. 

I want to plot the number of homesteads per year for each county in Eastern Oregon between 1900 and 1929. I can get all of the homesteading patents on this website: http://www.glorecords.blm.gov/search/ (By selecting "homestead original" under "authority"). However, it's huge pain in the ass to count for each county, each year, and would probably take me upwards of four hours. 

Is there anyway to extract this data without just counting it?
