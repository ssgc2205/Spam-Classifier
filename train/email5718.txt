I want to be able to look at my health insurance claims and see how they compare to other areas in the U.S.  I'm sure I'm not the only one.  But when I see a claim, I see that my insurance company paid $X for XYZ procedure.  I am often curious how does that cost compare to the national average or in other states.  Thanks.
