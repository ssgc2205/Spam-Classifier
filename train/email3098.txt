I think this is one of the more interesting city data sets that I've stumbled upon. It's a list of all active business licenses in [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses-Current-Active/uupf-x98q?category=Community-Economic-Development). I could explore this data set for days on end. Does anyone know any other cities something like this exists for? I'd love to see  one for some international cities, like Tokyo, Japan or Shenzhen, China, for example.  I found [www.data.go.jp](https://www.data.go.jp) but my Japanese isn't good enough to figure out where to start.
