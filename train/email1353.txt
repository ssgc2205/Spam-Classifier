I'm going to leave this question open ended mainly because I don't entirely know what I'm looking for. I've been looking into marketing analyst job positions among others lately however I've never really worked with marketing data. I've worked time-series regressions before however. Does anyone have any datasets I should look at and maybe some sample questions that I could that a manager or employer might as for? Or topic of optimizing marketing-mix allocation or marketing sensitivity curves.

Like I said open-ended question but hopefully someone in that industry might be able to help me out so I can get some practice, and locate areas of weakness I need to study up on. 

Thanks!
