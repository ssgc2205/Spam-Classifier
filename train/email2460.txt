Hi, I'm trying to find a dataset for the CT scans of COVID-19 cases. So far, I've seen this [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023028v3.article-metrics) use the dataset to train a classifier, but the link to their [data](https://ai.nscc-tj.cn/thai/deploy/public/pneumonia_ct) doesn't seem to work.

Does anyone have any links or ideas to access the data webpage? Thanks.
