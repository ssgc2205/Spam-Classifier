Hi, I'm working on a dataset about students' performance  in two different schools in Portugal. I have 30 covariates and response scores (one for each trimester). Unfortunately in one of the 2 schools I have just 36 statistical units.. Since I want to inspect if there were any mixed effects I was wondering if performing variable selection before trying to build a hierarchical regressio model.. thx!!!
