 Hello, I am looking for assistance in figuring out how to compile data for an activity that has numerous variables. To be more specific its for a moving company I work with and I want to figure out how long it takes for certain items to be moved from point A to point B. There are numerous variables involved such as distance from the truck, volume and weight of item, obstacles, etc. How can I get his data efficiently and how can I compile this data so I can compare it to future jobs and accurately estimate the amount of time its going to take based on the data I have? Thank you in advance for your help
