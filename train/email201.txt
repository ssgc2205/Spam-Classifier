You keep hearing about how this one analyzed 20 million clinical trial records and that one analyzed 12 million patient records to come up with some findings.  Where are these people getting this data?  I've been looking for some for months and only run into very basic high level data that is useless.  Are they partnering with pharma companies, or labs?  Tuft's University is one example of someone whose holding on to a hug data store and won't share or provide access to it, since they got it from pharma companies and have protection agreements.
