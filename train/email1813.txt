Hi everyone, I took a tableau course a year or so ago, and I'm good with dashboards and everything. However, I wanted to test out my bar chart race skills (I know they're banned in the dataviz subreddit, I promise not to share them there!) with a few datasets that are actually relevant and useful in current times (except covid). The datasets have to be in excel, not js. Does anyone know a direct link to a global climate dataset over the years or one sustainability-related maybe? Thanks in advance for any help! &lt;3
