Looking to make a viz comparing murders by illegal immigrants vs murders by citizens or something similar. Any ideas? Similar to this: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/03/30/the-myth-of-the-criminal-immigrant but I don't want to compare immigrant population to overall crime. I would like to compare citizen-caused crime vs illegal-immigrant-caused crime. Or even white-caused crime vs non-white-caused crime.
