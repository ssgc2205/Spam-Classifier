I'm a final year CS student, and I'm along with my data mining teacher, working on this ARM paper to present an improved ARM algorithm. That paper we have has used the EachMovie dataset and provided their algorithm results. We NEED that but I've been unable to find the original as it is being [cited as discontinued](https://grouplens.org/datasets/eachmovie/). A sparse version of it is available [here](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~chuwei/data/EachMovie/eachmovie.html) but when i view this dataset using pandas, it doesn't make sense, as the [original had 3 tables one per file](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lebanon/IR-lab/data.html) but this one is just combined into one with just 3 columns with numbers that don't make sense.  
The email for contact mentioned on this [site](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lebanon/IR-lab/data.html) for the dataset is now invalid, neither i can find a contact to that person.

So if anyone has the original EachMovie Dataset or can help me get in contact with someone who has it, then the help will be very much appreciated!
