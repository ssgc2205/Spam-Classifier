Hello all, first time posting in this subreddit however I’m in need of a data set for an R programming class. Criterion include at least 1000 observations and 10 variables within the data set. For this project we’ll be using classification methods such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis to try and make accurate predictions. Any suggestions are appreciated, the more interesting the data set the better!
