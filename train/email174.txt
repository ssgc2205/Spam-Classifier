Hello all.

I just found this data set on BigQuery where it has all of the public comments on reddit. I want to use it to create a chat bot using deep learning with python, but I don't know how to download the actual data.

Do I need to pay an annual fee to BigQuery, or is it free?
Can anyone help me?
