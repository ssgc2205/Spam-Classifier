Fellow redditors, I need help finding medical success rates for surgeries such as kidney transplants, open-heart surgery, brain tumor removal, etc. I already tried looking into medical journals, associations, and hospital records, but I'm coming up blank. I also need to know these rates over the course of like 50 years. Basically, I'm looking to see whether or not certain surgeries have progressed over the years in terms of success rates, and I need actual data on those rates (percentages or the like). Any leads, or any help at all would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
