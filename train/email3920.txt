This is the dataset I am working with:

 [https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects/discussion/89710](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects/discussion/89710) 

I would like to know what the state column represents.

For example, what is the difference between  "live" and "successful" states? what exactly the "undefined" state means etc?
