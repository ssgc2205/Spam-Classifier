[Google AI Blog: Contributing Data to Deepfake Detection Research](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/contributing-data-to-deepfake-detection.html)

&gt;Today \[September 24, 2019\], in collaboration with [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/), we're announcing the release of a large dataset of visual deepfakes we've produced that has been incorporated into the Technical University of Munich and the University Federico II of Naplesâ€™ new FaceForensics [benchmark](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/faceforensics_benchmark/), an effort that Google co-sponsors. The incorporation of these data into the FaceForensics video benchmark is in partnership with leading researchers, including [Prof. Matthias Niessner](https://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html), [Prof. Luisa Verdoliva](http://www.grip.unina.it/people/userprofile/verdoliva.html) and the [FaceForensics team](http://www.niessnerlab.org/projects/roessler2019faceforensicspp.html). You can download the data on the [FaceForensics github page](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics/).
