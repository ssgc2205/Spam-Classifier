Hi all,

I am looking to see if any of you data wiz people would be interested in creating a "dataisbeautiful" type image or fun analysis.

Two weeks ago, 4chan trolled a shirt mockup website by uploading gross, funny, and anything-goes designs. After all was said and done... many of us actually wanted to buy many of the shirts. So, I created a survey to see which shirts people wanted. The answers are... very funny.

The questions with large areas of blanks means that the question(s) were added at a later date.

Feel free to ask any questions!
