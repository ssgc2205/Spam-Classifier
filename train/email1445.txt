Hello reddit!

I am trying to find data on two things. 

I haven't been able to find data on poverty rates in Brazil on a state-by-state basis. Does anyone know where I can find this data?

Second, I am looking for data on soccer academy enrollment in Brazil. This can be of any level. I know there are several tiers of soccer leagues in Brazil. Enrollment data on any of them or even just a specific team's academy would be awesome. Does anyone know where I should go looking for this?

Thank you in advance!
