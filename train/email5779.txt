Hey there,

Currently i am dealing with a large amount of unstructured user related data.

General data structure:

User

\- Browsing history

\- Browser System Data

\- Mobile Phone System Data (iOS/Android)

\- Application Usage (Mac/Win)

And everything which can be somehow derived from the above (interest in politics, hobbies, interest in products, and so on).

All data is ongoing, means: User profiles can be watched overtime (possibility to detect if user "attributes" change overtime)

My question is very simple and straight:

What is the data worth?

Is the data already "sellable" if there are only 100-500 users or do i need 10k+ users?

Why is that so confusing? Because various sites publish different "values".

E.g. [https://ig.ft.com/how-much-is-your-personal-data-worth/](https://ig.ft.com/how-much-is-your-personal-data-worth/) and [https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5dkmd/how-much-is-is-your-personal-data-really-wort](https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5dkmd/how-much-is-is-your-personal-data-really-worth)h say my data is worth only \[micro\]cents, while others like [https://pawtocol.medium.com/how-much-is-user-data-worth-f2b1b0432136](https://pawtocol.medium.com/how-much-is-user-data-worth-f2b1b0432136) claim its around 35$ per month ?

Legal issues are being targeted by a lawyer, therefore i only need answers regarding the data value.

Thanks in advance!
