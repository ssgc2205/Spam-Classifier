I wrote a script for my Assignment, which extracts images from Google Images and creates a Image Classification Dataset.

I want to know if this would be helpful to others.

It might have a few bugs here and there, also I believe that with little adjustments it could be extended for other sites as well.

If anyone is interested, do tell me.
