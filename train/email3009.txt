Hey All,  


I'm doing a graduate project on invasive species management and I'm having trouble finding any information on management plans/treatment history/invasive surveys/vegetation surveys for natural areas in my area (Pittsburgh). Ideally I'd be able to find this sort of data for Frick Park, but I'm also open to changing my study area to somewhere nearby, maybe even the Maryland State Parks system. I'm somewhat familiar with Patapsco Valley and Deep Creek Lake state parks in MD, so either of those would work for me.   


If anyone knows of this sort of data for any of the three sites above, it would really help me out!
