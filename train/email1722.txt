I'm working on trying to "size" the US market for residential green/clean energy homes in the US. (ex. How has it grown and where specifically? Where are there local/state government incentives? How many homes have solar panels? etc. etc.)

It's a broad question so broad answers can be expected - any insight on even where to start looking would be appreciated, and of course, direct links to datasets would be awesome. Thanks!
