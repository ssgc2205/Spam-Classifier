Hi All,

Hours of googling has left me pretty dry.

I am after a data table which has historic university rankings, with subject if possible.

For example, I want to query "Cambridge","Maths","2015" or "Bristol","History","2012" to return a number rank.

Would any of you data peeps know if this exists?

Thanks!
