I am looking for datasets regarding the outcomes of Covid-19 patients given Hydroxychloroquine or a placebo. I have found the [dataset of 36 patients](https://www.kaggle.com/florianlandras/covid19-first-test-results-chloroquine-france) from the original French study as well as [an RCT in the US](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2012410) which will soon release their data. Are there other datasets that measure patient outcomes from the drug, preferably with a control group?
