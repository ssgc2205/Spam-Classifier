[We provide an advanced dataset on the Shopify App store](https://www.marketplaceapps.co). The dataset is real time and includes data points such as:

* Revenue estimates
* Install +  Installs over time
* Rank + Rank change + rank over time
* Reviews over time
* Many more

The dataset is used for many purposes, acquisition hunting, areas to develop new apps and competitor monitoring.  


A recent report I created on Installs on the Shopify App Store using this data is [https://newsletter.marketplaceapps.co/p/shopifyinstalls](https://newsletter.marketplaceapps.co/p/shopifyinstalls)
