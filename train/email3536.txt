Hello

 In some papers, it referred to a dataset of Beijing. For example:

 &gt;"The traffic network is located between the Second Ring Road and Third Ring Road in Beijing."

&gt;" 2-min travel speed data collected from three remote traffic microwave sensors located on a southbound segment of a fourth ring road in Beijing City."

&gt;" a dataset consisting of probe vehicle data collected in the urban network of Beijing, China, during one week from June 1st (Monday) to 7th (Sunday), 2015"

&gt;"north-east transportation network of Beijing"

I searched the internet for finding the dataset of vehicles in Beijing and just I found these links: 

http://jtw.beijing.gov.cn/

http://cgs.bjjtgl.gov.cn/chgs/Main.jsp

But Chinese is not my native language and I can not explore these sites for searching such data!

Can anyone that fluent in Chinese, explore these sites and check that can I request traffic speed data of previous months? Can I email them and request dataset?

Also, there is a contact link and some emails in this link:

Thank you
