So I am currently gathering information in a spreadsheet, which has a bunch of columns of data, and I was considering making a project out of it and creating a database app that has a frontend that makes it easier and simpler (and prettier) to actually enter the data. Are there any easy (no complex coding skills required) solutions for this? 

In case it helps answer the question, the data is from a game. Smash Bros. Three players in every match (the same three players). The data gathered is (for each player)- 

 \- Character selected

 \- Rank

 \- Kills (including WHO they killed)

 \- Damage Given

 \- and then total kills and stats like deaths, averages, K/D ratio etc is calculated and displayed as running totals automatically via equations. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the kills are displayed in a slightly odd way. Basically, the players initials are N, D and J. So the 'kills' are shown as something like "J2D1" if the N player killed J twice and D once. In the final app I would hope for the 'enter kills' screen to automatically show two icons (J and D for N, N and J for D, etc) that can be tapped the required number of times to quickly enter the data. If this is possible. 

So yeh, this is a slightly odd one maybe. It's totally unnecessary, as I can continue to do it using the spreadsheet, but as I say I figure it'd make a cool design project for my design portfolio. My programming skills are rudimentary though, so I'd rather use something that doesn't require too much advanced programming skills... 

Any thoughts?
