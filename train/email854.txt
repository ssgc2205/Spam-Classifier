I wonder if someone could help me to find a dataset containing a time series of the anaerobic digestion process, the data would come from sensors installed in the plant. This data set could contain data like:

 - pH

 - Temperature

 - Pressure

 - Components of the substrate

 - Any physical/chemical information

 - Etc...

 - Gas output



While the gas output is relevant, i'm just looking for a dataset which contains some of those features. If there is no gas output info, I would still like to take a look at it :)

This data could come from biogas power plants or even wastewater treatment plants.

Can someone give me a little help? :)
