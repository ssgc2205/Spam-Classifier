Hi, I'm looking for a free dataset out there that contains a list of companies and their respective industry or category. For example, on Crunchbase, it shows this for [Airbnb](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb):

&amp;#x200B;

Categories 

Hospitality, Marketplace, Peer to Peer, Sharing Economy, Travel, Travel Accommodations

&amp;#x200B;

But Crunchbase requires a paid enterprise license for this. Is there a source out there that's free to use? Thanks!
