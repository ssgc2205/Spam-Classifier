Hi guys,

I'm working on a computer vision project and I'm looking for a specific type of dataset. The dataset should consist of aerial images of birds, preferably while the birds are on the ground. 

I've already tried to look for videos which contain birds on the ground but had no luck finding anything useful. If you've come across such types of footages, please post a link in the comments.

Thank you!
