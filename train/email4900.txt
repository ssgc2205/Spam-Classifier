&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; **\[IMPORTANT UPDATE:** *From February 12th the definition of confirmed cases has changed in Hubei, and now includes those who have been clinically diagnosed. Previously China's confirmed cases only included those tested for* [*SARS-CoV-2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_novel_coronavirus)*. Many datasets will show a spike on that date*.\]
