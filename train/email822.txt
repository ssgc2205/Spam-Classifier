Hi all,

I am supervising a student project in financial data science. The student needs intraday stock price data for Google ('GOOG' on the NASDAQ), either minute or hourly.

Does anyone know if it is possible to obtain this? I have looked everywhere and only found expensive services such as Quandl ($800 a year subscription...).

Thanks.
