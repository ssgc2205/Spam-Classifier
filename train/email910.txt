Hi everyone!

Next Monday (8 March) a team from the Digital Collections Programme at the Natural History Museum, London will be doing an AMA on r/datasets. Our mission is to create digital records of the 80 million specimens in the Museum's collections and release their data to the world, and youâ€™ll be able to ask us anything about it!

When: **Monday 8 March, 16.00-18.00 UTC**
