I'm an undergraduate psychology student working on a research project. As part of our project, we are looking for a set of photographs. The set includes at least 1 color picture containing a person's face (preferably head shots) taken every year from age 4-18, as well as 1 in the person's 20s and 1 in their 30s (another in 40s would be great, can't be too hopeful).

&amp;#x200B;

Brief summary of the project: To assess people's ability to match voices to faces based on age across a developmental period.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this might be difficult to find, but I would greatly appreciate if one of you had a set or knows someone who does. If you can help, please message me and we can talk more about details. Also, if you know of somewhere that contains this resource or another place to search for it please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all!

p.s. I hope I did this right, I'm new to Reddit
