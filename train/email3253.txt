Hello, I would like some assistance with regards to ordering data for orders. I have a screenshot of said data which I will try to upload in the comments section.

The issue is:
-orders are collected in column A using Product code numbers.
-data in Column B and C correlate. Column B are the product codes and column C product description for all the products in the store.
-evidently, not all products are ordered.
- I need to link the product codes for the products ordered to the corresponding product description in column c

Of note:
- these are not the actual products ordered. Just an example
- the data cleaning will be required for the past 5 years
- some of the product descriptions and codes have been updated and are thus missing in the columns b and c. 
- this is only an example. The actual excel files contain over 4000 rows for orders placed and 6000 for the product code and description references.
 
Is there a simple way to clean up this data rather than doing it manually? Iâ€™m quite new to this so I would be very grateful for some guidance.
