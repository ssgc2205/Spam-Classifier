I have an assignment that I’m working on and I’m stumped. 

I am writing a paper analyzing rule-based vs relation-based countries and how it impacts international business. 

I can’t for the life of me find enough variables to measure this or differentiate between rules or relationship. 

There have been a few surveys measuring trust but that was all I could really find. 

Does anyone here have any experience doing an analysis like this or could think of some variable examples?
