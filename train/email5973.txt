I am looking for QA datasets based on scientific literature. For example the [BioASQ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12859-015-0564-6) or [PubMedQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06146.pdf) are concerned with the biomedical domain and based on publications in PubMed. Doesn't necessarily have to be in the biomedical domain, anything that could be answered from papers would be much appreciated.
