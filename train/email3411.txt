Hello! I need a dataset for a project for uni that I thought was going to be really easy to find, but it turned out otherwise.

I'm looking for an average annual country temperatures (in csv preferably) per year (since 2005 and up to 2019, if possible).

I've looked through quite a few websites already but couldn't find anything useful.

Ideally column names would be the year (2005, 2006,...) and rows the country name.

Any help would be super appreciated!

Thank you!! &lt;3
