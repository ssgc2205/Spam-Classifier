Hi! I'm working on a small analysis in this dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult 
but so far I'm a little confused about some of the variables:

capital-gain
capital-loss
fnlwgt

Could someone explain me what's the meaning of these fields? I've tried to google it but it's been hopeless...thanks in advance!
