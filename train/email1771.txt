Hi everyone.
I am looking for a dataset in which Radar-Doppler measurements have been made in the following scenario.
An Ego vehicle with the Radar mounted on both ends at the frontside  follows another vehicle which i want to observe.
After searching I only find datasets mostly with Video data but no Radar-Doppler data 
Would be thankfull for and suggestion.
