Our startup is looking to get some data for a SaaS product. Some of data we are interested in are:

(i) Number of login
(ii) Billing date
(iii) Payment date
(iv) Churn (maybe?)
(v) Signup
(vi) Number of visits, signed-up users and paying users

Is there anyone who is interested to partner with us to share some data? We will keep it anonymous and send you back a report at a small fee.
