Hi, I'm working on a research project alone where I need to collect the posts of a subreddit from the last 3 years. That makes a lot of posts. I'm not interested in the comments, just the posts are enough. I'm aware of praw, but it won't return more than 1000 most recent posts. I'm also aware of psaw but I just read that it also has the 1,000 limit. It seems like 4 years ago there was [https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit\_posts](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_posts) where people could use SQL queries to obtain what I want, but it's no longer of existence. Meanwhile [http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/) exists, but the most recent posts look like from 2019 and I hesitated to download them since there is no way of specifying the subreddits, looks like it will give all posts.

So, is there a currently supported, easy way of collecting a subreddit's posts that will contain more than 1K posts? I highly appreciate your suggestions.
