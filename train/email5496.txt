Hey,  I know this question is really  basic, but I've spend days trying to  find a guide about this and I  couldn't. So I've collected the responses  and I have them in excel, and  now I want to use a software (MaxStats)  to do statistically analyze it.  I've added a picture for the sake of  clarity.

Could  I just replace all  the answers with numerical values? In the image I  added I tried to  show what my questions are like. Can I just replace 0 -  1 times/hours  with 1, then 2 -3 times/hours with 2 and so on? If I do  this for each  question and have values ranging from 1 - 4 on each  question, will the  software be able to do correlations/statistical tests  between them?  Will it know that 1 from this Q1 is different from the 1  from Q2?

Or is there a better to turn questionnaire-type answers into something a statistical analysis software can recognize?

I'd   really appreciate some help, tutorials online always talk only about   the statistics part, but they rarely say anything about how to get your   survey data ready in the first place
