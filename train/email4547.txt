I'm looking for data to see the share democrats/republicans have in state primaries for as many years as possible. Does this exists or will I need to create?

EDIT: I think the dataset might be here, but I am not a UMich student. If anyone can bypass the login and willing to share, please PM me. http://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=282896&amp;p=1885080
