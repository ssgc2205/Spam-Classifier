ISM PMI historical releases

Does anyone have ISM data, with more meat and potatoes than the index score? I have been managing to scrape the most recent postings, but Iâ€™m limited on how far back I can scrape since the oldest reports are only available in PDF form that I have been able to find.  Ideally I would like to be able to better evaluate the industries individually. 

I tried posting this is r/algotrading to no avail. 

Thanks for taking the time to read.
