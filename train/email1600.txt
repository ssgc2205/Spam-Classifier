A journalist friend wanted a dataset of all the unclaimed money of the WA treasury. Probably not a very interesting dataset for most people, but I figured I'd upload it publicly in case anyone wants to play around. The scraping script is also included:

* The dataset contains 436,042 entries
* About 52 million dollars unclaimed in total
* Scraped by using this search form: https://www.treasury.wa.gov.au/Unclaimed-Money/search/ with a list of the 5000 most common first names, and 5000 most common surnames
* Probably contains at least 80% of entries

A couple of interesting entries:

* $915,703 unclaimed - no known beneficiaries: https://imgur.com/a/IRq3vPp
* $21 unclaimed - from the year 1900: https://imgur.com/a/AK96reF
