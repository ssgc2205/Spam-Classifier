I'm searching a dataset containing the gpu prices during the last \~7 ish years. I don't need every existing gpu model , i was thinking about the most 15 relevant ones per year.

I've already found a dataset made by user u/YourVibe a couple of years ago, but i need the data of the last years. I've tried messing around with data scraping with python but with terrible results.
