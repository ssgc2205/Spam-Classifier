Greetings, experts!  I have just finished taking a course to master Tableau in preparation for a new career I am starting in a couple weeks.  I will be the Business Intelligence Analyst for a company primarily focused on **Utilization Management Services for Healthcare organizations**.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am familiar with the BI reporting tool I'll be using there (I'm more fluent with SAP/BOBJ tools), **I'd like to practice by building a relevant dashboard**.  I'm an IT professional, but brand new to healthcare - so I'm not sure where to begin.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate any suggestions on:  

 **1) where I could get some sample PHI data (or any healthcare data you feel would be applicable);** 

 **2) and guidance on the types of analyses I should perform.\*** 

&amp;#x200B;

*\*It would help me greatly if you can simply provide some sample 'client requests' I might come across in my new role and I could determine what analyses and/or visualizations I need to provide the (pretend) client with a valuable solution as a dashboard.*

&amp;#x200B;

I am so grateful for your time.  :)
