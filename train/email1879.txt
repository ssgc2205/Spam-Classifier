Im looking for some datasets for a workshop Iâ€™m giving in data visualization in matplotlib. I want some basic datasets which have a even number or categorical and numeric variables so I can show basic visualizations, If anyone has some good datasets to teach data visualization or are good for data visualization and have a good amount of categorical and numerical columns, feel free to pm me links or drop them here!
