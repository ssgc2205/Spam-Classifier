I apologize if this the wrong place. 

I am wondering if someone could point me in the right direction. I’m looking for a few things for US data.

-Total deaths for the past few years. Preferably broken up weekly and by state. I found some data at data.cdc.gov, but I can’t find CSV format.

-I would also like to find percentages of people who received the COVID vaccine. Preferably broken up by week and by state.
