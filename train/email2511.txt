I have a supplier side dataset which contains the name of the supplier and its corresponding top 3 customers (buyers) and the top 5 products it sells. These top 3 customers (buyers) and products are divided across 8 individual columns. I want to search names of the suppliers based on its customers and its top products. Is there any way I can simplify this dataset without applying individual filters across all 8 columns using Tableau or Excel (preferably)? Help would be really appreciated.
