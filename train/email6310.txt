An example of an ideal dataset would look like:

 * There are some devices, say computers
 * Each computer has **parameters** (number of cpus, amount of ram, hdd space, etc.)
 * Also we know some **time-series** data (energy consumption log, load log, etc.) about each of the devices
 * And we need to predict whether it will fail soon or not.

This is just an example, the domain of the dataset does not matter, it could be hospital records about patients, some other devices, unicorns, whatever. The **main requirement** is that each instance has some number of useful "static" features and some number of useful "dynamic" features.

Has anyone seen a dataset(s) like this?
