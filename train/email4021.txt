I'm currently writing a project about electoral forecasting, and I keep seeing references to the "Gallup political and economic index" in academic papers from as recently as 2009. Unfortunately I can't any reference to it anywhere, apart from on Gallup's Bulgarian site (?!). I've done some extensive googling, and checked my University library website. Anyone have any info/clues? Thanks in advance!
