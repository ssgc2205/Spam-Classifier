So guys I've been trying to dig up some particular data but I just can't seem to find it. Was wondering if anyone here could possibly help me out or direct me. So, I'm looking for shipping/transit data and seeing which region or state receives the most amount of damaged shipments or boxes. Trying to narrow out what areas are good at handling packages and what areas aren't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas if Amazon, USPS, FedEx or someone else might have this data?
