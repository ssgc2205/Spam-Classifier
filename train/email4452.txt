So a lot of us have probably seen the chart that plots THC to CBD ratio over time, but that only goes up to 2014.  (Also, the data was gathered from seized supplies, however that might affect it.)  

Is there ANY data on the average THC to CBD ratio for years 2015-2020?  Or anything that might help me to figure it out?  e.g. average annual thc/cbd levels, etc.  

Thanks in advance!
