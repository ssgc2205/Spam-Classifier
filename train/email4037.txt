If anyone here is in need of a reliable, ultra-affordable source for sports data, why not check us out at:

https://www.MySportsFeeds.com

We're aiming to make sports data available to everyone, whether lone wolf developer, student researcher, or large multinational corporation.

Available in real-time via RESTful API, or we can push it to you post-game in XML/JSON/CSV formats.  You get boxscores, schedules, scores, play-by-play, and more.  And NO long-term commitments or contracts.
