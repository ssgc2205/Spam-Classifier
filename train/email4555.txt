Hi everyone. Glad to meet you all. I'm new to the datasets subreddit, but some of us from /r/algotrading are putting together a community data project. As you all know here in /r/datasets one of the biggest issues for trading/backtesting is getting access to good quality financial data, which can be prohibitively expensive and the free APIs that are out there all have ridiculously low query limits. So our community data project is designed to solve that... we are trying to compile as much public data as possible (equities, options, forex, crypto, futures) and build an open source API to query it. We want to democratize access to financial data so everyone who needs access can have it.

If there are any other like-minded traders/coders who want to help us work on this project, let us know. We'd be really glad to have your help in this. We already have some great data and we are getting more every day. What we really need is programming help so that we can process and clean it all and store it in an orderly way.
