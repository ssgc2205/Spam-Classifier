Hi Y'all, 

I am looking for a large corpus of technical product descriptions to use in an ML project that I am working on.  An example of these kinds of data I am looking for might be like this NewEgg post for a coffee maker: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA1JX4754385&amp;ignorebbr=1

Specifically, I am looking for textual descriptions like the kind which can be found on the "Overview" tab.  Going with the example above: 

"The Knox KN-TKCUP Travel Size Single Serve K-Cup Coffee Brewer is designed for people whose hectic morning routines don’t allow time to sit and enjoy a pot of coffee. The KN-TKCUP quickly brews coffee using a disposable K-Cup so you can quickly fill your travel mug and get out the door without worrying about waste or clean-up.

Quick Set-Up with Minimal Clean-up
The KN-TKCUP uses single-serving K-Cups to brew coffee so there are no coffee grounds to dispose of or coffee pots to clean. Just fill the tank with up to 12 ounces of water, place a K-Cup in the holder, and press the power button. When your coffee is done brewing, all you have to do is dispose of the K-cup and you’ll have a hot cup of coffee to enjoy on your morning commute.

Save Money on Coffee
Traditional coffee makers that use pots are great if you need to brew several cups of coffee at once, but, if you only need to make a single cup, you’re going to end up throwing out a lot of coffee. K-Cups are ideal in these circumstances because they allow you to make only the amount of coffee you need so you don’t needlessly waste water and coffee grounds."

Anyone have an idea where I might be able to find a few million of these kinds of descriptions without scraping them?
