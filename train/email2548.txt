Hello guys, apoligies if this is not the correct subreddit.

I am currently working on my Master's Thesis and I'm a bit of a csv novice.

I am in possession of a very large comma seperated csv file that contains a bunch of data i need for my analysis. The data is scraped from a website (kickstarter). However, the way the data is presented makes it hard to use for analysis.

The variables are as follows


Title | Goal | Amount pledged | Is Funded | Amount of updates | Title of update | Text of update | likes pr update | comments pr update
-----|----|--------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|------------------

However, in the culonm 'title of update', 'text of update', 'comments pr. update'  and 'likes pr update' the data is presented in a single cell e.g. ['20 likes','35 likes'] for a project with 2 updates.

I am looking for a way to present this better by seperating the observations into n-amount of rows, where n is the amount of updates, and the standard columns (title, goals and so on) are just empty.

I am dealing with around 50.000 projects so this need to be automated in some way. Can you help me?

Let me know if you need a screenshot or a sample uploaded

Edit: a friendly guy pm'd me a script so I got it!
