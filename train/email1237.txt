I have two different options on what major I can go into. These are either IT or management information systems 
Computer science is a no go.

I've been hearing a lot online lately that I don't need a special IT major to go into the IT field. I want to know out of these two majors which skills I learn in them will I need to learn in college because I have been hearing a lot lately that you can learn IT skills online or on the job. So I want yo make sure I get my money's worth for going to school. I already completed my business classes and they count for both degrees. 

The  MIS/ classes  skills I will learn are data analytics, project management, data warehousing, Rapid application development, social media management, business intelligence, ETl, business analytics,  data analytics, system analysis, and database management systemss

The IT skills/ classes are IT Project Management, networking and telecommunications, software applications, infrastructure science integrations, information security,  cyber forensics, information security, web performing monitoring, html, Java script, OOD, CSS, troubleshooting, data organization, and system analysis.

As for what careers I want to pursue business intelligence analyst, web administrator, some form of IT manager, and Search marketing strategist.

Which one should I go for?
