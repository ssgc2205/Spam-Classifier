I've placed all publicly available Reddit submissions into Elasticsearch and the API is fully open to anyone who would like to learn how to use Elasticsearch.

The endpoint for the search API is: 

https://elastic.pushshift.io/reddit/submission/_search/

Front-end examples are available here:

https://elasticsearch.pushshift.io/

**To learn more about the Elasticsearch Search API**

Please visit:  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html

For any examples they use that end in _search, just use the URL above (https://elastic.pushshift.io/reddit/submission/_search/).  

Thanks!

**Edit**  The index ends around late December, but will have everything in the next day or so -- I'm just tweaking the ingest logic now.  Thanks!
