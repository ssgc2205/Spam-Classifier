**Documentation:**  https://github.com/pushshift/api

There has been a lot of requests for documentation for the Pushshift.io API.  I've spent some time on this and have created a living document that is under active development.  I am also open-sourcing the entire API and putting the code up on Github.

Please feel free to make suggestions for the documentation or to create pull requests to help make the API better.  

If you have any questions about the API, please post them in here. 

Thanks!
