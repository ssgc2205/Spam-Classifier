Let's say there is a poll that 100 people voted on. The
topic and choices with votes in parentheses are as
following:
Which brand of TV is better?
1. Samsung (38)
2. Sony (34)
3. Same thing (28)

How would you interpret the data?

1. "Samsung" would be the answer bc it had the most votes

OR

3. "Same thing" be the answer be it encompasses the two
individual options in a singular choice and the two
individual options (as well as choice 3) are fairly evenly distributed

Side question: 
How does choice 3 affect votes? Couldn't I
have drawn the conclusion they are about the same just from having choices 1 and 2 polled?
