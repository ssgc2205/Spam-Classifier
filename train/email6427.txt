Over the course of a few years I have downloaded all my replays from the game CS:GO (Matchmaking 5v5 on 64 tick Valve Servers). For my personal use I use CSGO demo manager https://www.csgo-demos-manager.com/ which can extract a lot of data from these replays. I have played this game solo for over 99% of the time. It has a massive amount of data in it, and a massive amount of different players. It is a record of allmost 3000 games (2974 to be exact) with almost 30000 different players (Me + 9 other steamaccounts for every game). If anyone is interested, I am willing to share the whole archive. I sometimes look at the statistics, but mostly use it to track all players I have met to see who has been banned by Valve's systems.

All demo's are watchable in CSGO from every players point of view, nothing is manipulated.

If anyone is interested. Let me know. I'm willing to share the whole archive (including my JSON files from the demo manager, they have a bit more data, because I lost allmost a 1000 replays due to a diskcrash). You can also run them through the demo-manager yourself.

Reply if you are interested, or DM me.
