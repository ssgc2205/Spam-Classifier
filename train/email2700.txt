Hello, I am looking for data on textile production during the Industrial Revolution. Alternatively, knowing the inputs for creating textiles throughout the Industrial Revolution (x amount of coal, x amount of cotton, x amount of labor), and how it changed across time, would let me impute the production.

Thanks for any help you can give.
