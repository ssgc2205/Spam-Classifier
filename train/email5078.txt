Hi there,

I'm looking if the Flickr API Download Tool and face landmark extraction Script which nVidia use to create the FFHQ Dataset.

I try to create my own to train a new StyleGAN2 model from my own Pictures, but my json strings are not compatible ( dlib.shape\_predictor(model).tolist() ) and I want to compare the code.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks
