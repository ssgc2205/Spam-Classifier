Hello, does anybody know of a dataset of subscription prices for U.S. newspapers? I've found the U.S. newspaper panel from Gentzkow, Shapiro &amp; Sinkinson, but this ends in 2004. Was hoping to find more current data. 

I'm also looking for a dataset of newspapers with paywalls on their websites if possible. I've tried to construct this myself programmatically but it is proving difficult.

Any leads would be super helpful!

Thanks!

P.S. Gentzkow et. al. data can be found here for those interested: [https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/30261/version/6](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/30261/version/6)
