 I'm a university student and I'm trying to find a dataset on which I can apply data mining algorithms and techniques. Basically, it should be an all-encompassing database, such that things like student's health, dropping out stats, admission stats etc. all is from a COMMON body of people and not separate. The thing is, we're looking for a dataset which is kind of "individual", i.e that it has responses separated by students and not collated together. We want to analyze those by using algos like apriori algorithm, etc. I'm unable to find a common dataset, or a dataset, that includes all of it. Any tips?
