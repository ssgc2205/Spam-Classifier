Hello,   
I'm looking for a large dataset (preferably over 150+ images) of pixel art character, but the characters need to have the same shape concept (round, or standing), i would even prefer if the image was only of the character's face.   
Does anyone knows any datasets or websites that would suit my goal ?

Preferred size would be 24x24
