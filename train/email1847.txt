I've seen many data sets of US Cities, which usually have data like populations and center point (Lat/Long).   


What I've been curious about, and unable to find, is tourism data by US City.   


For example, Panama City Beach is often touted as the world's most popular spring break destination, but it only has a population of 12,018 (From the US Census of 2010). If you were to strictly be looking at population figures, you'd be lead to believe that Panama City Beach isn't a very popular or lively place, but tourism data would show that it is frequently visited.   


Does anyone have any idea on how to acquire this data or any thoughts regarding this? Any help is appreciated!
