I'm looking for financials on Women's Soccer, especially UEFA &amp; in particular champions league.  Revenue, revenue by team, budget, marketing expense, profit, etc.  Finding it difficult to find anything broken down to that level not mixed with men's or other categories.

Any good data sources or at least reports to extract from?  I've got some students interested in analyzing for a university project.
