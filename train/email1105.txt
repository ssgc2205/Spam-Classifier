The Reddit May, 2017 (RC_2017-05.bz2) file is now available.  For the month of May, 2017, a total of **79,810,360** publicly available comments were ingested.  This barely edges out the number of comments for the month of March (79,723,106 comments) to become the current top month for Reddit comment activity.

The entire comment corpus now contains 3,249,317,297 comments ( ~1.8 TB uncompressed / ~298 GB compressed).

**Some minor changes:**

1.  The "can_gild" key/value field has been removed from the dump because of its uselessness.  

2.  I have increased my plan with Verizon FIOS to 300Mbps to help with download speeds.  Top download speeds are now ~30 megs per second.  Again, if you'd like to help out with this project, donations are kindly accepted (but never required).  The link for donations is https://pushshift.io/donations

3.  Fields are now ordered (canonical) within each JSON object alphabetically to help increase the compression ratio.  

4.  The "subreddit_type" field has been removed because all data in my dumps are always publicly available (there are no private subreddits in the dump).
