Hi /r/datasets!

I'm doing a project centered around NFL salary data, but I'm having an extremely difficult time in finding easily accessible data on historical salaries. I'm not even talking about like salaries from 1986. I just need information going back to like, 2010. 

[This is basically what I'm looking for, but for previous years](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/salary.htm). Pro Football Reference does not appear to have previous years.

Spotrac has good data, but it doesn't seem to break it out yearlyin an easily digestable manner. If in fact it does and I'm missing something, let me know.

Over The Cap also doesn't appear to have much historically, even recent history.

Does anyone know of any datasets out there which could help me out? R Packages? I'm open to anything.
