I am looking for a huge list(csv?) which includes all countries, cities,villages, airports, cafes, etc, for a project that requires structured places for easy search.

And alongside each place, it would be nice to have the country, city, gps coordinates, and anything else.

Does anyone know of such a dataset I could buy/download?
