I'm trying to find a datset that has web DOMs for pages that have forms (with or without the `&lt;form&gt;` tag). Ideally it would be great to have some bounding box info of each element, but that is optional

The scenario we are looking at is to build a form understanding model to replace a heuristic based approach

Thanks!
