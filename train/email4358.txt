I am trying to get my hands on the stats, or even just the points on all the world cup players that FIFA has in their fantasy football game. (http://en.mcdonalds.fantasy.fifa.com/) I have made a team - doing fairly well - and I can see how they score after every game with the breakdown of the points they earned. I am trying to see the same for ALL the players. Any ideas?
