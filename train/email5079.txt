Hi r/datasets.

Friendly fokks at DoltHub here. We launched a $10,000 data bounty to collect US school information, both K through 12 and Universities.

Lots of data already in but potentially more fruit left. At the very least, if you need a database of US schools in SQL format, we're here for you.
