Hi,

I just joined this thread and saw a lot of questions like 'is there any dataset XXX with specific condition YYY (i.,e past 20 years, specific region KKK, etc) here.

just wondering if there is any dataset trading market? if not, why yet? (may be too rough question).

I know there are a lot of publicly available datasets provided by big tech companies, governments and research labs, but these datasets mostly for general cases and I guess there are/will be a lot of dataset demands for edge cases as AI industry is getting specific. For example, if I need tennis swing coach machine learning trading data from swing/serve data today, I am not sure that is something easily accessible.

What if there is such platform enabling person or companies to trade the data set with fancy dataset filters? would there be a lot of needs? the platform can provide well-organized filters/download/upload toolsets as a middle man.

Is selling public data illegal? like If I sell a dataset from Google lab or U.S national lab to someone else and get money, would that behavior be illegal? or is there any license thing on dataset like open source ?
