Hey r/datasets,

It's me again, the CEO of DoltHub. We finished our second hospital price transparency bounty last week. We paid to have an open database built of 100M hospital prices, this time with a little bit more manageable schema. 

Check out the blog post here:

And the database here:

We're looking for people to use it to tell us how it can be improved.
