Hey all, I am looking for a dataset of examples (posts, tweets, whatever) of cognitive distortions / negative thinking patterns, with no luck so far.  Maybe someone has seen a study that used a similar dataset or in general something interesting around the subject (I have seen a couple of research projects, but not too many that were very promising). Also, any datasets around subjects of mental health, CBT, negative self-talk...
