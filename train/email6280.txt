Hello,

First time posting in this sub. First semester in Grad school and looking to focus my new journey on the use of E-signatures. I am easily able to find articles and posts regarding the use and statistical analysis but nothing on raw data.

I have tried several databases including our library's subscriptions, Google scholar, and various open source and gov related data sites, but have come out with nothing useful. 

Essentially I need a raw data set that I can analysis and draw conclusions from myself.

Thank you for reading and thanks in advance of anyone willing to help.
