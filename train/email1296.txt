# **EDIT** to clarify some excellent questions in the comments:
- I am using Ubuntu 16.04
- I don't need to annotate the sentences/text in each row, just need to check (one at a time) that the assigned label is correct. Evaluation of the correctness of the label is done manually, not by any programmatic process.
- `sed` and `awk` would be fine if I knew beforehand which lines need to be changed (which I don't), which is why I need a more iterative interactive approach.
- Given the large number of rows (~4 million) in the CSV, a spreadsheet approach would probably require me to break the single CSV into multiple files. I could be completely wrong about this as I don't do a whole lot of data preprocessing in spreadsheets.

--------
I have a set of CSVs with text and a classification in them. Some of these are incorrectly classified in the raw data and I would like to fix the labels by hand.

I found http://sloth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ which is used for fixing/creating image labels by hand but haven't yet found something for text datasets.

I could, of course, load the CSVs up in a spreadsheet but I have close to 4 million sentences and I would only like to go down the spreadsheet route if there is nothing else available.

**Sample Data**

\# | Class | Text
---|--------|---------
1 | 1 | This is some text
2 | 1 | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
3 | 0 | Sed vestibulum tempor enim vel porta
4 | 0 | sed laoreet nisi accumsan non. Integer et sollicitudin velit.
5 | 0 | Duis mollis ante odio, at lacinia arcu ullamcorper sit amet.
... and so on. Let's say I would like to change the class of rows 2 and 4.
I've identified these by some manual process but I'm hoping the tool can show me the rows one by one.

Worst case, I'll write something myself to do it but want to be sure there isn't something out there already.
