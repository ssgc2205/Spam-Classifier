Hi,

I'd like to try training a model to determine the target of particular pronouns in a text. The pronouns I'm mainly looking for are he (masculine singular), she (feminine singular), and they (group or gender neutral singular).

Does anyone know of a dataset that would contain this information?
Thanks
