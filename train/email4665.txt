Hi All,
I don't have much experience writing crawlers, and I'm not sure what the best to get information about reddit posts is... could someone guide me in the right direction?

**Question I'm trying to answer:** Something seems a bit off about a particular reddit post I saw today:

https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/79i4cj/youtube_user_demonstrating_how_facebook_listens/

I'm interested in doing some clustering analysis on early posters to that thread and see if there is in pattern among the users who helped get the snowball rolling...
