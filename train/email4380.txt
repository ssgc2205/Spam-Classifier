I'm in the middle of creating an infographic about migrating to Spain, and could really do with a run down of the daily weather reports for both Spain and the UK in 2013.

If anyone knows where I can get information such as the weather condition each day (eg, sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy) and temperatures that would be amazing. 

Apologies if I'm not posting in the right sub, please direct me to the correct place if this is the case.
