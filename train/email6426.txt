I have been searching around through Google and canâ€™t seem to find any good tools for end-users to assist them with converting existing data formats to a more open standard.  

Moving spreadsheets to a CSV format is easy, but what about converting MS Word documents to a functional, and clean, XML format?  MS Word can save into an XML format, but it is not clean.  
Can anyone recommend tools/applications that would be easily usable by end-users that would allow them to either format MS Word into usable XML or plain text to XML?  

We are trying to get some traction on the Open Data movement but the largest obstacle we are facing is from day-to-day users.  An easy-to-use tool/application to help them put their data into a semantic format for Open Data would really help break that barrier.  They must exist but I am just not finding them.
