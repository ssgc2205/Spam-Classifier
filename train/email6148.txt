Hi All

I am looking for a dataset that can provide the following details of bookings made with commercial airliners :

From City or Country

To City or Country

Booking Date compared to actual Travel Date

No of passengers

Mode of Ticket - Ex Economy, Business etc

Airline

opted for any ancillary services

I have looked around a lot and have come up short mostly, fare data seems to be available but that doesn't help me with the other parameters. I would be okay with any paid datasets as well.
