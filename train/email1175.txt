I'm trying to build a supply chain/demand forecasting model but it's hard to find any good datasets for supply chain. I only need one and can generate toy datasets to go around it so I'll have 3 vendors for my model. A dataset that has known capabilities and constraints would be ideal, I've only found [the SCSM dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-shipment-pricing-data/resource/4f4acde2-ab4c-4cf0-98a4-80053f7d2d31), which  might suit my needs. If anyone has suggestions for me I'd really appreciate it.

Also a dataset to do simple demand forecasting for a real or synthetic product is also required for this project, but I feel like this will be easier to find.
