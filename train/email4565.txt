Hello everyone hope you are doing great! :D

I've created (as the title says), an Othello Dataset in case anyone is interested! I guess that it is more helpful for people creating an AI for the game but still.

It has around 25k games :)

Hope it is helpful for someone!

Edit:
I'm now creating another dataset that will have a better format to feed an AI with all the board configurations and respective moves of the winner of each game :)

Have a great day!
