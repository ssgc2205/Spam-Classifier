I've been looking for U.S. healthcare claims data for a time series analysis at a more granular level than annual. I'm particularly interested in Medicare data and have scoured the CMS website, however, everything I've found has been on an annual basis. Healthcare claims data, in general, have been hard to come by, especially at the frequency that I need.

Any ideas on where to find this are greatly appreciated.
