Hi, 

I am a patent researcher and heard about the vast collections of old catalogs.  I am looking to browse these from time to time when I am looking to find old art/references.  

Currently I am looking for an application using spool/reel/rolls for electrical cable or other similar strands(tubing,barbed wire,carpet rolls) etc..

Thanks for any info to point me in the right direction.
