Hey guys ..I got an assignemnt from the my uni where I have to apply multiple operationes on two data set. I am unablw to find any suitable dataset which can meet these requirement. I would realy appriate the help.

Following are the condition for two data set required.

1. At least two data sets should be merged.

2. Your data set should include multiple data types (numerics, characters, factors, etc)

3. Your data set should include variables suitable for data type conversions so that you

should be able to apply the required data type conversions 

4. Your data set should include at least one factor variable that needs to be labelled

and/or ordered.

5. At least one of the data sets that you use should be Untidy. You need to explain

why the data set or data sets you used is/are Untidy. Then you need to apply the

required steps to reshape your data into a tidy format.

6. At least one variable needs to be created/mutated from the existing ones (e.g.

the data may contain income and expense variables and you may create a savings

variable out of the income and expense variables).
