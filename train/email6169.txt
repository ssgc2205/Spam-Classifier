I would like to find a data set that is similar to https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database# 

The only problem with the RIAA site is that, while it categorizes records by award, there are no specific values of records sold, gross earnings, or the like.

Any help in finding a website that I could scrape these values is appreciated. Thanks!
