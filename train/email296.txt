Hey there, 

I work for a charity and we are wanting to look at data for shootings in america. 

We found one API for mass shootings but we would like ALL gun crime and also the api to be filterable by date period. So we can gets stats for 2011/12/13/14 etc...

As we are based in England we are not sure if there are any government or public knowledge ones. 

Please help..
