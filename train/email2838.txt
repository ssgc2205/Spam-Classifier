Hi all,

I am a geoscientist interested in developing my computer programming skills, and one skill I am looking to develop is web scraping. I am looking for websites of environmental monitoring that are updated very frequently (for example, the USGS Earthquakes site) to scrape the data and analyze it using coding. I want it to be environmental data specifically because this is what I'm passionate about and what motivates me to undertake this project in the first place. Thank you!
