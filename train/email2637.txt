Hi there,

I would like to analyze how different tactics and punches affect the outcome of the boxing bout.  Does anyone have a dataset or resource where I can look for detailed amateur boxing statistics on fights and fighters? 

Things I am interested in:

\- Amount of punches split by type - i.e. jab, cross, hook, etc.

\- Amount of power punches;

\- Punches landed;

\- Knockdowns;

\- Points scored during bout;

Would be awesome to obtain something like this!

Thanks!
