I'm writing a research paper on sexual behavior and religion, but I'm finding that most of the surveys that use these data (such as the GSS) are at least 5 years old.

I am interested in follow-up on the state-level study showing that religious states have more pornography searches. The concern I have is that the individual level data they cite (and use) is from 2007, which is ancient in today's world.

Thanks!
