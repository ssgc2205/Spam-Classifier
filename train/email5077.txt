Something that is like:

Category

- subcategory

- - sub-subcategory

- - - -sub-sub-subcategory, etc

And once you reach the bottom, there is some numeric data for individual units.

If it were about people, for example:

Americans

- by race

- - by state

- - - by county

and for each person, there are stats:

income

car ownership

favorite color

etc

It doesn't have to be important data - I'm just working on a newb project of building a drillable, interactive data display.

Obviously, 300 million people is too large, but something structured like that would be nice.


Thanks!
