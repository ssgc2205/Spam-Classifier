I'm looking for a data set that meets the criteria named in the title (or some of them) based on latitude and longitude. I would say that at least 100 rows for North America is a must (and btw. it can be any continent besides Antarctica), so imagine a 10x10 grid over North America with some information about each square.
Preferable size 400 rows, but anything above 100 would do (even 100000).
Most important is the type of terrain (forest, desert, mountains etc.), mean elevation and temperature.
