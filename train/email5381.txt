Not sure if this is the right subreddit, if not can someone please let me know where would be better?

So for Football (Soccer) it's 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss.

But if you can only Win or Lose what is the best way?

3 for a win, 1 for a loss.

3 for a win, 0 for a loss.

3 for a win, -1 for a loss.

2 for a win, 1 for a loss.

2 for a win, 0 for a loss.

2 for a win, -1 for a loss.

1 for a win, 0 for a loss.

1 for a win, -1 for a loss.

Any help is appreciated :)
