Hi r/datasets,

CEO of the company that built [Dolt](https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt) and [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) here. 

Most folks on this sub should be pretty familiar with Dolt and DoltHub at this point. But if you aren't Dolt is Git versioning wrapped around a SQL database. DoltHub is a place to share databases in Dolt format. We think it's a better way to share open data on the internet. No importing. SQL comes with the format.

Every month we'll be publishing a blog on new or interesting datasets on DoltHub. This is the first in that series:

If you put a dataset on Dolt and DoltHub you want us to spotlight, [hit us up](https://www.dolthub.com/contact).
