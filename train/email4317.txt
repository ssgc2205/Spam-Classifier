I'm conducting a literature review for a paper I'm collaborating on, and I'm supposed to be gathering any available sources of data/research that has been done on the availability of open police/arrests data around the world, but I'm struggling to find any. If anyone knows of any specific organizations who are collecting such data, or any existing datasets, I'd appreciate any tips. Thanks in advance.
