Hey all-

I'm working on a mapping project that will explore data from the Arab Spring, including:

-death tolls

-number of protests and where they occurred (which city)

-number of twitter updates from that country

-other relevant information

I'm having some trouble finding up to date, reliable data covering these topics. Can any of you help me out?

Thanks!
