Hi, I’m currently searching for datasets that have scans/pictures of diabetic patients’ feet, specifically patients that have peripheral neuropathy since ulcers are present on their feet. 
If this isn’t available I’d also like MRI scans of diabetic patients’ brains and those patients must have peripheral neuropathy. 
Anything would be greatly appreciated since all the professors I’ve contacted haven’t responded yet since their research in this field has taken place a couple years ago. Thank you
