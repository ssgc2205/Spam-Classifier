I am working on building a language classifier in speech/audio samples. I have been trying to find a dataset which may have considerable number of speech samples in various languages. The audio files may be of any standard format like wav, mp3 etc. containing human voice/conversation with least amount of background noise/music.

I am unable to find any such dataset. Can someone share link of any speech dataset that may be good for this research.
