FiveThirtyEight's weekly column, Riddler, had a contest a couple times this year where people submitted strategies, along with written comments on their thought process. The data sets are available here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/riddler-castles

I have used this data set in two blog posts ([here](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2017/05/29/winning-the-battle-for-riddler-nation-an-agent-based-modelling-approach/) and [here](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/who-survives-riddler-nation/)) and I think more can be done with them. Some people could see if they can develop a better algorithm for playing the "Battle for Riddler Nation", while others could look for patterns in how people played, particularly in their written explanations, and if some are better predictors of success. I think a lot can be done with these data sets and I'd like to see other projects.
