Does anyone have suggestions for a dataset comprised of consumer preferences?

It seems the Netflix recommendations dataset is no longer available, and I'm looking for something similar.

The idea is to use machine learning to predict consumer preferences, e.g., a consumer likes X and Y, and the algorithm would predict that the consumer also likes Z based upon the dataset.

Thanks,

Charles
