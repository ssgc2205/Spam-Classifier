Hi All,

I have some ~2,000,000 addresses in the UK that I need to geocode. Rather than pay a bulk geocoder I am looking for a spatial dataset that I can use to geocode the addresses to Lat/Lng points. 

Ideally right down to the house number, but street-level resolution could be ok, 

Anybody know of datasets available?
