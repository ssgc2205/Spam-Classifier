Quick question to everyone.

How often do you face data consolidation issues where

1. Some of the data does not have all the columns needed.
2. Some of the data has more columns than necessary.
3. The data types of columns are not matching across datasets.
4. The columns are not always in the same order across datasets.
5. Some of the data contains rows that should be dropped because those rows are not relevant to the analysis.
6. Some of the data is spread across 2 or more files and needs to be denormalised
7. There are misspellings in the data due to human errors

If this rings a bell:

1. How do you solve some of these issues?
2. How much time do you spend doing this sort of work in a month?
3. Which industry do you work in?
