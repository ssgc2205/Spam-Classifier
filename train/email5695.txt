Hi everyone! I am looking for a dataset of participation in recreational sport over time. I am looking for as broad data as possible (gender, age, participation (number of times played) and/or spend on sport and country). 

As a starting point I will really take any leads, no matter how exclusive to any of the variables. 

Thanks so so much!
