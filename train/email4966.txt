I'm looking for a large dataset to practice some clustering techniques and correlation analysis on. Anything with two or more columns is fine, I'm just struggling to find anything that has any raw data instead of statistics. The small sets aren't helpful for cluster analysis but I've used them for correlation analysis.  
  Any help would be amazing!
