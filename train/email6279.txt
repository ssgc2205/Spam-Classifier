Hi all, I have searched high and low for a 2016 presidential election results spreadsheet that shows the number of votes attained *by Trump and Clinton* individually, in each *county* of a given state, by *vote type* (i.e. vote by mail, early vote, election day). Some spreadsheets have 2/3 of those conditions but never all three of them. This is to help compare against this year's results, given the likely changes in vote type. I am specifically interested in Florida's results but would like those of other states if they exist. 

I have searched every official source I can think of and many unofficial ones, but haven't been able to hit the jackpot. You can get the data from each individual county (e.g. here: https://enr.electionsfl.org/ALA/1654/Summary/), but not all in one place. If anyone knows of a dataset that collates all of this into one spreadsheet, I would be hugely thankful!
