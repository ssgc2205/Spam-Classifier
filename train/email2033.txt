What would you find interesting to compare with data on homicide and/or suicide as cause of death? I want to use some eurostat data to create visualisations for a study project and looking for an interesting angle. I know I can find some random correlations with many statistics, but I'm not necessarily looking for those. Just something interesting to consider when talking about these causes of death.

Alternatively, I'm also considering using data on passport power (how many countries a holder can enter without any visa). Again, this will unsurprisingly correlate nicely with many economic factors, but I'm trying to think of someting less obvious and got stuck.
