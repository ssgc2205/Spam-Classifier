Hello,

I need to analyze a Dataset using HMMs. I am aware of movebank.org but the datasets I found there had coordinate measurements at different time lengths which makes it hard to calculate step lengths from.

Does anybody know another free source of movement data that offers equal time intervalls?

Thank you in advance :)
