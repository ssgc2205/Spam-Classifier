I was wondering if raised body temperature could be an early sign of an infection, even when I'm not yet consciously noticing it. 

This could, for example, be useful because fever is a very common symptom of COVID-19, so maybe measuring my body temperature every morning could give me an indication of when to be extra cautious (not going grocery shopping that day, etc.).
