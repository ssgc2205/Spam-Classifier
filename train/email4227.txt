Throughout my life I’ve never been able to find my own data. To my fault, it’s because if it doesn’t show up in the first Google result I give up for most things. However, it seems like people can quickly find any piece of data they need so I feel like I’m doing something wrong.

How do you get the data you need for any random topic? 

For example, I’m currently trying to find income distribution changes by neighborhood over time. Data.usa showed up as a result which has been awesome but either the UI is bad and I don’t understand how to get what I want or the data just isn’t as detailed as I want. 

If someone could please walk me through their process or at least tell me it’s not as simple as I think it is, then I’d appreciate it
