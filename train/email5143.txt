Hello r/datasets, I am asking for help finding historical data on educational attainment by state, specifically OHIO. Any year would be useful but as far back as 1990 would be helpful. I am doing a research paper on the affect of Education on Economic Growth in the state of Ohio for my Capstone course (graduation course). Any information related to Educational impact on Economic Growth would also be helpful.
