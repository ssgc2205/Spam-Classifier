Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a dataset that comprehensively covers US zip codes and corresponding geographical data; this would be for business use, not personal use, and I'd prefer some guarantee as to data quality.


To that end I had a friend recommend: http://www.zip-codes.com/zip-code-database.asp


The samples they provide look reasonable, and it comes in at 1/5th the cost of: http://greatdata.com/zip-codes-lat-long


Additionally, the Zip-Codes.com dataset includes attributes like population and income, which could potentially see some business use as well.  

I'm hoping someone can weigh in and let me know what their personal recommendation is as to this sort of dataset.

Thanks!
