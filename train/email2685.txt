Dear all:

Is there a database of the pictures of members of congress, senate, and state governors, preferably from 2020 but any time after 2018 should do. I am interested in evaluating attractiveness of politicians and would appreciate if someone can point me to a database with a standard picture setup for the politicians. I am talking about a typical picture of politicians with the US flag in the background, or any other general format where the picture specifications are standardized. 

Thank you.
