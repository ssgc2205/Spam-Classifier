Hello. I've been working on a project that involves using the Riot Games API to scrape various in game stats. 

The dataset contains 53452 rows of players' from matches. It was stored in a SQL database using Python then exported into CSV format. The dataset contains 65 features including winner/loser. Some of them are non-descript ordinal which you can remove and there are a few more that do not pertain to solo queue match stats(dominion stats that do not get tracked). 

I plan to upload the dataset with 44 features in the near future. The github should also contain teamstats dataset which are team objective stats recorded from the same games.

All matches are after 9-21-2015 which is a day after a certain patch. Can't remember off the top of my head. 

Let me know if you have any questions. Dataset is released under MIT license. 
I have done various work on this including knn, logistic regression, correlation/covariance analysis, and some other feature selection techniques. The final report should be completed in two weeks so I will be uploading that to my github as well. Have a great day everyone.
