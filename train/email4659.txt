Hello,

I am currently trying to find a decent dataset on used cars. I would like to not only have information about the car itself (make, model, mileage) but I would like to have consumer report data as well (how often was maintenance, things broke, etc etc) on that same type of vehicle. 

My goal is to determine the cars with the most “reliability.” I am still not quite sure what key metrics I will deduce that from.

I am currently looking for a new car and wanted to have a cool exploratory analysis project to show for myself, so any clever ideas, hints, or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
