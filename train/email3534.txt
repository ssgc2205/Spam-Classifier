I'm trying to see if there is any correlational data that can compare the rise of SpaceX and the average person's interest in humanity going to space, or space colonization, or some way to gauge popularity, or perhaps even the amount of money given to nasa. 

My issue is figuring out if this data is correlated or not, and then second finding any of this data.

Thank You
