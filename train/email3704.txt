Hello everyone, 

I have a survey on Qualtrics in which I exported an excel file. I have tried to import the excel file into SPSS version 27 and I am not able to run  descriptive statistics properly. And the format on the excel file is different from the SPSS version. Am I suppose to create variables before I import the file into SpSS/ Or is there something else I am supposed to be doing. I tried to search this up on youtube but I keep across older  versions of SPSS and Excel
