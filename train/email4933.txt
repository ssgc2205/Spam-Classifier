I'm just finishing up a project this summer and put together this dog breed dataset. Doesn't exist anywhere online and AKC's site makes it hard to extract the info so I figured I'd make it public.

Essentially it just categorizes all the AKC dog breeds into 5 breed size categories (xs, s, m, l, xl). I also added the average weight of each breed into the file.

Hope someone finds it useful so that they don't have to rip their hair out trying to find this info.
