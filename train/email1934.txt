Hi, I am searching for a dataset of carotid artery bifurcation transversal (b-mode) ultrasound image sequences. By "sequences" I mean images taken in known distance between each other (ideally dense).

Thanks in advance

edit: added photo to make it clearer

also In case it helps someone what I want to do is to develop a method to reconstruct the 3d shape of the artery and the bifurcation as part of my master thesis. I would also be helpful to know the stenosis percentage
