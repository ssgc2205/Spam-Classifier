I'm doing some research on the popularity of older songs, i.e. which have remained popular, which have faded, and which became popular later. I know this data is out there because I can search for it on [https://chartmasters.org/spotify-streaming-numbers-tool/](https://chartmasters.org/spotify-streaming-numbers-tool/), but it's slow, lacks release dates and limits me to artists that I know to search for (e.g. if a band released a song that didn't chart, but it became popular years later, I won't know to search for it).

Thanks for any help!
