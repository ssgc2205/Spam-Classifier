As I said in the title, I'm looking for several datasets related to:

* Clean energy generation devices (wind turbines, solar cells, etc)
* Charging points usage 
* Users data (may be an app's open dataset? amount of energy bought, price per kW)
* Cars data (battery usage, routes, CP's usage)

If the data has a timestamp on it it'll be really useful.

The main idea is to make a POC for my country. Thank you in advance!

Note: I think that they'll be more than one dataset from more than one datasource so, idk how to tag the post.
