Hi, was wondering if anyone had experience or advice for someone looking to sell data generated by users on a connected TV app. (I think this post belongs here, but let me know if there's someone else that would be more appropriate)

A few years ago for a course I was taking I programmed an app for connected tv devices (think Amazon Fire, Roku or Apple TV). At the time it didn't get much traction, but over the past few months though it has skyrocketed to 30k DAU and 100k MAU. 

Without mentioning what the app is, I think there is some pretty unique characteristics about the usage dataset generated that could be valuable to others, however I have no clue where to even start looking for buyers. I know in the mobile world it's as easy as putting a data broker's sdk into your app and then they pay you, but after some pretty extensive googling I can't find anything similar for connected tv.

Would love to hear if anyone has thoughts or ideas on who I can sell to and has to begin pricing/knowing the value of my data as usage continues to increase.
