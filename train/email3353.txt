Hi,

I am interested in a dataset that compiles longitudinal information on Doctoral candidates, i.e. the attrition rates, completion rates, job placement after graduation, student and program characteristics, etc.  

Any leads for paid or freely available datasets are welcome.

Thank you.

PS: I am agnostic about the field, or even the profession. A similar dataset for some other professions such as Management consulting or Investment banking may also be useful.
