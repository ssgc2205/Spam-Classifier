I am new to Data Mining (CompSci major in a Data Mining class) and I have to do a project analyzing a dataset (with at least several thousand records) and was hoping to find an interesting dataset relating to Psychology/Psychiatry that would work well with a classifier. Does anybody know of a good dataset / a good place to find one? I'm using WEKA so .arff extensions would be the best, but anything I can convert into .arff works as well.
