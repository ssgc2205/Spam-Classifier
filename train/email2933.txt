Hello, I am currently doing a project about microplastic pollution in waterways for school. I wanted to create data visualizations for this topic, but I am having a difficult time locating spreadsheets. I would like to explore the following topics: microplastic effects on the food-web, chemical makeup of biofilms on plastic, concentration of microplastics in waterways, different types of microplastic (fiber, fragment, pellet, film, foam), or anything else relevant to this topic at all. Please if you know about any of these topic please help me. I really am having a hard time finding spreadsheets to process this information. I would really, really appreciate any help.
