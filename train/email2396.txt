I am looking for the source campaign finance data for Cyrus Vance Manhattan District Attorney. 

I've searched [http://www.nyccfb.info](http://www.nyccfb.info) and [https://nyccfb.info/follow-the-money/data-library/](https://nyccfb.info/follow-the-money/data-library/)

Does anyone know where to get the source data files?
