Hey Guys,  


I am looking for someone who will help us scrape Crunchbase, we would need VC info together with all their portfolio companies. There is more than 40k VCs with average of 5-10 Startups funded. So the data set will be quite complex.   


Are you interested in earning money fro CB Scrape? Hit me up: jkucera00@gmail.com
