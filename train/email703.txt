 

I cannot seem to find statistics anywhere on the internet on mean IQ based on specific groups (race, gender, etc)(ex: mean IQ of male Asians in the US, or mean IQ of male Jews in England).  
The closest thing I found to it was on [https://openpsychologyjournal.com/contents/volumes/V3/TOPSYJ-3-9/TOPSYJ-3-9.pdf](https://openpsychologyjournal.com/contents/volumes/V3/TOPSYJ-3-9/TOPSYJ-3-9.pdf)

I'd like to know if there is a website that has IQ statistics based on this. Or if there is a special website all the "cool statisticians" go to.
