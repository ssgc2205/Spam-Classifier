Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing a project for school where I analyze how the global pandemic impacted the global maritime shipping industry, such as how many countries are impacted and the variation in the number of crates shipped.

Does anyone know any useful datasets I could use for this?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks
