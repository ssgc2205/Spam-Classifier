I've tried everything, but for some reason it seems impossible to find datasets that includes a simple list of the councils in England sorted by their group, and a list of covid cases also sorted by councils.  I'm not British so it may be a lack of knowledge of how their government sites work. 

Anyone know a place to find these?
