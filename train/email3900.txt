Not sure where else to ask but maybe my fellow data fans work with similar data: I am currently working with data out of the US Census surrounding various industries, primarily out of [Census Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t). I am mostly looking at business statistics by county to do some market sizing exercises using targeted industries NAICS codes. My question is coming up on how businesses might be classified. 

For example, if I am looking at an area that contains a Amazon shipping/Fulfillment center, would that individual facility be classified as a Warehouse (NAICS Code 4931: Warehousing) or would it maintain Amazon's overall NAICS code since they are the parent company (NAICS Code 4541 Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses)? Another example, Would a WalMart Distribution Center be appropriately coded as a Warehouse or would that maintain Walmart's overall General Retail classification?
