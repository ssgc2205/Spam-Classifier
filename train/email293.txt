Hello fellow data people,

I am a statistics major in my senior year of college looking for a data set I can base my next project on.  Specifically, I am looking for a data set pertaining to ecommerce for which I can run a logistic regression on.

I was thinking that the response variable (which duh...needs to be binary) would be something like whether or not the customer bought anything (1 if yes; else 0).  Predictors could be the amount of time spent on the page, number of clicks, visits per week, number of ads on page, etc., etc.

Ideally the data set would have at least 1000 rows and not be a *complete* nightmare to clean up...though some cleaning is always expected.  

I've seen a few sets on kaggle already, but none of them seem to be appropriate for a logistic regression. Any thoughts?

Thank you in advance!
