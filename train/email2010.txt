I have a data set of lat/long for the US where there were reports of earthquakes along with x and y coordinates and times when it happened. I want to make a map of the US and have a time that increases and shows where/when those earthquakes happened.
Is there any software out there that I could use to help me make this a visual project?

EDIT: There's a column for date time, and lat and long for location, and magnitude of earthquake. I wonder if there's an application where I can plot lat and long and create that slider.
