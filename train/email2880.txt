I have some toy examples that usually come with literature on basic neural networks, but would like something a wee bit more complex than a logical AND gate (the most popular example). I considered creating an artificial dataset, but read those are only good for reproducing results, and validating multiple implementations of the same algorithm, etc., but shouldn't be used for actual prediction. Where can a get a complex, real dataset that is linearly separable?
