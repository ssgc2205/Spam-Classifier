Hello m8s

I crawled reviews of 2400 different chocolate bars as well as metadata and US and Canadian chocolate producers.  


The data is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/chocolate-ratings).

Also, the simple crawler that captured this data is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/chocolate-ratings-crawler).

As always, credits go to the  Manhattan Chocolate Society:
