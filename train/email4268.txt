Hi.

I'm looking for a dataset that has at least 3 parameters

.x1. Parameter before the influence (HB,  Hematocrit,  platelets, or some basic unchanging params: weight, BMI)

i1. Influence parameter (treatment drug, operation or something that influences changes in first parameters)

x2. Parameters after the influence (HB after operation, Hematocrit after drug intake).

x1 and x2 must exist parallel to each other, so I can see their change.

&amp;#x200B;

Will there be a dataset that meets my needs or HIPPA won't allow it?

(P.S. I dont need sex, race, gender or whatever param that may dianonymize patients. 

I can also use autogenerated ones if such exist)
