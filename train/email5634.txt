Doing an analytics project on golf and wondering if anyone has any good sources for tournaments, their winners, and the scores posted by the winners. Tried to look on PGA Tour, but doesn't seem like they have it anywhere easily accessible... Would like to go as far back as the 60s if possible.

Worst case scenario, the results for all the majors spanning back to the 60s.
