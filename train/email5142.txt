Hi! I'm a Data Science student working under a project that needs 90 days of fitness and sleep activity data. I have data from 4 friends but to make an impressionable project, I would need data from a larger inputs I am interested in gathering all fields that a smartwatch measures such as steps, calories, sleep patterns, BMI, heart rate etc,. As I'm only interested in the health statistics, I do not need any personal information and this will neither be shared during presentation. Anonymity will be maintained You can export the data from the fitness app on your phone or watch with just a click. You can mail the files to me at : 1MS18CS046@msrit.edu

I would really appreciate your help! Please feel free to mail if you have any additional questions. Thank you very much in advance.
