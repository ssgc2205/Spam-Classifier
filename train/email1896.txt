Subdivide 'injury' into 'minor injury' and 'serious injury'. I'd like to see what the stats are so I can compare different activities such as skiing, rock climbing, surfing, football, etc. and their corresponding accident rate per human per hour.

Be interesting how they all compare to driving too.

Is there any decent source on the web, preferably in CSV format?
