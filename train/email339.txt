I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/), but the only source for the file seems to be a torrent that nobody is seeding. Is there somewhere I can get this or a similar archive? I'll need to know whose comments they are and what the parent was. The more information the better, really. Thanks!
