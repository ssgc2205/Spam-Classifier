I'm looking for the number of days per year in each US state where the minimum temperature was above, say, 72 degrees. I've found this data in pieces but I need a lot of it and don't have the time to gather it all.

Does anyone know where I can find this? An API would be helpful too, in case I want to change the criteria.

EDIT

Thanks to everyone for the help. It's here:

The trick is to narrow down to a few stations in a city, then you can up the date range. Still have to do it for each state, but that's acceptable.
