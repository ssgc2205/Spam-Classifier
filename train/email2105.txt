I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question but you are used to datasets so you might have good recommendations.

We plan create data and store them is this way

`Campain1Folder`  
`-&gt;labelling.json`  
`-&gt;measures1.csv`  
`-&gt;measures2.csv`  
`-&gt;measures3.csv`  
`-&gt;measuresN.csv`  
`Campain2Folder`  
`-&gt;labelling.json`  
`-&gt;measures1.csv`  
`-&gt;measures2.csv`  
`-&gt;measures3.csv`  
`-&gt;measuresN.csv`  
`CampainNFolder`

Q1) is this an acceptable format ? Or what would you recommend

Q2) How do you store the information top avoid loss ? On a shared disk / sharepoint/ box/ git ?
