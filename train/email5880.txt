Hey, I'm working on a project that requires to detect text on containers like shown in the image, I have a very very small dataset hence the accuracy is low. I would be grateful  if you could guide me to where I can find similar images, I've searched Kaggle and other major dataset sites but no luck. 

I'm even open to a synthetic dataset and suggestions on ways to create them.   
Thank You
