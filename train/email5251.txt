Hi, there are a number of websites that let you calculate the cost of carbon offsetting for example a flight from London to Singapore in Business Class generates X tonnes of CO2 per person and costs $Y to offset. Obviously there's some kind of model behind all of this but I was wondering if anyone had a dataset of common global routes with mileage, Tonnes of CO2/person (economy and business split if possible) and offset cost. I've tried google data search, and a few websites, but they only seem to have ad-hoc calculators. TIA.
