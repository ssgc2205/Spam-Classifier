First off, I don't even know if this is legal but I asked out of curiosity as I know that the nature of "legal" or not depends on the country and on the leaked data. (so if this is considered illegal feel free to delete the post \^\^' )

I looked up on wikileaks but they are mainly (or exclusively?) pdfs and not actual datasets.
