I am working on a project to find the affect of temperature on Covid-19 virus,for that reason I made a repository on Countrywise weather data from the first outbreak of that country.I know its too early to conclude anything based on this dataset but i think the repository will help data analyst and scientist to understand the behaviour of Covid-19 virus better.Thank you.
