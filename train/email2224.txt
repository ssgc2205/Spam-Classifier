Hi guys,
I have a question regarding entire lists of keywords/hashtags. There are many lists online claiming to contain the top 10'000 etc. most used hastags in Instagram/Twitter etc. - they seem to be more like online search tools.
For a research project at work I am interested in a "full" set/list of Keywords. Does any of you know of a FREE Database with multiple thousands of keywords/ hashtags to download? Or a paid service that offers this?
thank you,
