Hey guys,

I'm building a panel dataset for my thesis, and I need some player level data from the English Premier League and the Championship league (division below the EPL), such as shots on target, passes per game, shots on target, etc.

The premier league's website has most of the stuff for teams that were in the premier League, but I also need data from some championship clubs that indicate the performance of their players, using these indicators. Would anyone know of a database/Website that has such a thing? 

Cheers!
