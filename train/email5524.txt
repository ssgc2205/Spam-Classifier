This doesn't have to be an excel data set. I'm looking for 2020 population projections for about 15 specific counties but I need to be able to see the age breakdowns in the Under 5, 5-9, and 10-14 age segments that the census does. I've been told that the Census Bureau has this information on its website but I've been searching for an hour and can't find this information. Anyone know where I can find it?
