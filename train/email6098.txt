Hello r/datasets,

I am currently working on a software solution for a new piece of hardware and have stumbled upon an issue with the data we have. 

I am looking for "clean" images of human iris'. When you search google for any manner of [human iris pictures](https://www.google.com/search?q=human+iris+macro&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqqemRqaHiAhW7HzQIHSHkCjgQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=656), you get 99% with one or both of the aberrations that come with photographing something like this.

1) Light reflection

2) Eyelash reflection or background reflection.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if there is a dataset of clean iris', ideally just the iris (the full iris, not portions of it) and not the entire eye with not aberrations? I am looking[for something like this](https://www.eyesight-foto.de/en/eyesight-iris-foto-galerie-2017/), but they only have several on their site. 

One of my colleagues suggested talking to an iridologist that [takes pictures like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=iridology+iris+pictures&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS721US721&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=isz:lt,islt:10mp&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXzfzVqKHiAhURpJ4KHT1ZAnwQpwUIIQ&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=656&amp;dpr=2.75). This is getting closer, but there are still aberrations in some of them. I did contact a few of them and they said they can't release without patient permission, or won't release at all even with permission because it is really 'weird'. I don't blame them one bit, it is pretty random.

I asked an optometrist too just as a long shot and she was pretty confused as to where to even start, but ended by saying she really couldn't help.

Additionally, there are different types of photography that can be used to image an iris, so this dataset  can be in regular images, infrared, or scattered-light photography.   
Any/all suggestions welcome.

Thank you!
