As some of u may know, I belong to dat grp of people who are insta-crazy! I mean who doesn't love to scroll through endless pics of overedited selfies and avocado toasts, amirite?! So, let's get one thing straight, u aint cool until u have ur own #instagold glam squad. I mean, who wants a normal life when u can curate an insta-life, filled with sponsored posts and filtered pics, with the help of ur own personal paparazzi?!

And don't even get me started on the endless benefits of insta-stardom. Fame, fortune
