Dear reader of this post, 

I am looking for help in my Ph.D. research, I am looking at finding big data on nonprofit organizations to apply machine learning techniques and provide analytical solutions. I have no specific requirements for this data except the size of it. The contribution of this research will be for these organizations to benefit from their data. 

If anyone is keen to help, please leave a reply and I am really appreciating your help.
