Hi all. I know YouTube data is particularly tricky to find nowadays, but I'm doing an academic project and looking for data that can help me track the rise of the "Let's Play" on YouTube. I tried Socialblade.com, but that was only so helpful. Any help would be appreciated, even links to a dataset that I would need to purchase (assuming it is quality data). Thanks!
