I am looking for biomedical databases similar to the Wisconsin breast cancer database (available at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)) ). This database has 9 features (each feature values being integers ranging from 1 to 10) and two classes â€“ benign and malignant. Defining characteristic of this dataset is that the higher feature values generally indicate higher chance of abnormality (malignancy). I am looking for other biomedical datasets having features with this property (not necessarily integer valued, can also be real valued; preferably with low number of features also - less than 30 or so)
