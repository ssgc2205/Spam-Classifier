I’m working on Physics Informed Systems, and I’ve been struggling to find some data from transport phenomena of the atmosphere. I had this idea that if I could dig enough on the web I could find almost anything. As time goes by, I realize that this is much harder with datasets. 

I want to test the models I’m working on with data from climate transport phenomena, but I come from a different background. Do I need to look for Climate Datasets in a more specific manner? If so, which terms should be useful to perform such a search?
