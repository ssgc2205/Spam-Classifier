Hello everyone,

I am trying to build a model to predict diseases in patients, looking at their health record dataset.
Looking out of visits, diagnosis codes, physicians, medication, transcript data etc.

Any lead is much appreciated. Welcome to join building the solution as well. 
I have previously build a model on predicting single disease (diabetes) using similar dataset.
