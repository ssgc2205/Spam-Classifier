I am interested in finding a dataset of message-reply pairs of conversations with dirty talking.

By dirty talking, to be clear, I mean inappropriate for work. I looked around a little bit but I couldnâ€™t find much of anything large enough. If you have any ideas on how to create a dataset like this on my own, please share.
