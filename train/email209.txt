I'm looking for a corpus of either psychologists running clinical sessions or people writing personal journal entries, maybe if neither of these exist another good option is personal letters between people (like WW2 letters back home). I'm looking for personal accounts of people having a problem, with some reflection of said problem ocurring as well.
