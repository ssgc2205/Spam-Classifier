Hello, I research gentrification and am currently looking for geographic data (preferably GIS) of where exactly gentrification occurs in US cities.  I created a model which predicts gentrification based on US Census data and want to compare these predictions with real world examples. The problem is I only found a lot about single gentrification events, but not for example a map of a whole city, where the gentrification hotspots are marked. If you know something like this, please post it here. This would really help me.
