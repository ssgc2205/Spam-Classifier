Hey everyone, I am currently looking for a dataset that contains a consistent update on minimum wage in in the US by state. To clarify, I am looking for an updated yearly dataset. If anyone knows of such a thing, I'd greatly appreciate it. If you are interested in this, I am planning to start generating one within the week.

EDIT: Now that I have been directed to this resource, would anyone have any direction regarding the specific dates in which minimum wage was changed? Thanks again!

Thanks!
