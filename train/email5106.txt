Since Shanghai Disneyland recently reopened, looking for live datasets of the wait times.

Also looking for data relating to the actual queue lines at all the attractions over in Orlando. 

Ex. Haunted Mansionâ€™s line is 2500 ft long and can fit max amount of guests, while the ride itself can accommodate x amount of guests per hour.

Would appreciate data also from Universal and SeaWorld Orlando locations.
