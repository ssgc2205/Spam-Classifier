I originally created this dataset to train question answer neural nets, but perhaps other people can find interesting usages for it!

The data, along with details on how it was created can all be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/FMCumhaill/Reddit-QA-Corpus).

EDIT: probably should have mentioned it  was created using BigQuery and r/pushshift. Shout out to them as always!

Feedback welcome :D
