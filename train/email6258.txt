Does anyone know how I could gather a dataset of images of clouds? In particular, photographs of small clouds from the vantage point of humans on earth (as opposed to satellite images from space).

This is what I have in mind:

I have found [Cloud Data Set 
 from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cloud), but the data no longer seems to be on the page (or am I unable to find it)?
