# Usecases

The obvious usecase is to build confirmed case trackers for areas within the UK.

# Caveats

Public Health England is only testing a small proportion of the population. The true number of cases is likely to be many many times higher than they are reporting in their data.

**You should not use the data in a way which makes people think they are at less risk than they really are!**
