Hi guys, 

I'm trying to build a toy project about consumption of vehicles and searching for a small dataset having car weight, to be integrated with the data I already scraped (consumption data for different vehicles).

It does not need to be 100% accurate (the range indicated in Wikipedia would be enough).

Do you happen to know where to find it?
