Looking for complete OEM part listing for anything with a part number.  If you were to build a 1998 Toyota T100 part by part, which OEM numbers are required?   Would prefer Toyota, but could start with any make/model or preferably all models/years of a big manufacture.  Its a tall order, do you know if anything like this exists and is available publicly?

Example of the data points in an individual record:

Updates:.

Looks like parts are available in the Product Classification database (PCdb).

If I understand correctly, PCdb is available for free?  You must signup with Autocare Association at [autocare.org](https://autocare.org) and then login to  [https://autocarevip.com/Account/login?ReturnUrl=%2F](https://autocarevip.com/Account/login?ReturnUrl=%2F) to access PCdb.  Anyone get this to work?
