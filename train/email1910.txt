I'm trying to figure out what FitBit (or similar smart watch/smart device) people have for tracking data. I'm having a hard time finding good reviews that focus on this as a main consideration.

Main biomarkers to track would be the standards   
\- heart rate  
\- gps/steps/stairs  
\- sleep tracking

Any advice would be helpful, including things like how hard it is to export the data, and what portions of data are actually accessible after the export.
