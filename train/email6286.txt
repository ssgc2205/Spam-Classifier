So recently I visited the website pay scale. On their college salary report and the highest pay jobs with a bachelor's degree. Its basically a list on how much each college major makes. That website reports that people who get a Business and Information Technology degree can expect to make around $60,000 dollars once they graduate. The website ranks the major 85 out of 827 different types of bachelor degrees people can get. For reference information technology ranks 223, management information systems ranks 95, and business administration ranks 409. They rank different majors based on how much people can expect to get paid from receiving them. 

1. I was wondering if anyone can tell me if it is worth pursuing on getting a dual major in business and information technology based on what that website says or is the dual major to broad?

 2. Would employers find it valuable if I got this dual major since I have skills in both IT and Business? 3. Career titles I want to go for are a web admin, IT manager, BI analyst, and search marketing strategist. Would this be a good double major if I want to break into these fields? 

Any suggestions would be great.
