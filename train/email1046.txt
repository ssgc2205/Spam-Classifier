Hi everyone!

I am a student currently researching on plant leaf diseases and was looking for some datasets for the same.

I stumbled upon the CropDeep dataset but I was not able to find any links to the dataset.
So as the question suggest, I wish to know if it is publicly available?

If no, is there any other similar dataset that could be useful in my situation.

Thanks in advance.
