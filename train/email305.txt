 Hello everyone! I have a question regarding the set up of my data-set and I just stumbled upon this subreddit and if there is any place to ask this question... it has to be here! So I have practically zero experience with Possion regression and will need to utilize it for an analysis that I was handed at my internship involving count data. I have not been fortunate enough to locate info/resources on how my actual data-set should be set up within excel before I pull it into SAS to do the analysis.... I was hoping to see if anyone had links/advice/knowledge they could bestow on me to get me going on this. Thank you all so much in advance! :)
