Hello,

I'm looking for directed, weighted graphs suitable for Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, data should describe "real-world problem".

For now closest I've found:

(*) [Network representing the neural network of C. Elegans.](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/)

But I don't think that using MaxFlow on data above would give any useful informations.
