 Hi all

I graduated from my university 2 years ago. While there, our department was able to provide us (only for my major) with access to recent social and political surveys (on people's views towards social and political issues) in SPSS or CSV format. I lost access after I graduated. I was wondering if you could help me find a resource for such data.

One example is the AfroBarometer survey and the Pew World Value survey. I really like to stay up to date how such opinions change regardless of the location of the survey (region where it was conducted).

Thank you in advance
