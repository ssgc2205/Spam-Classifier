Show off, complain, and generally have a chat here.

Discuss whatever you've been playing with lately(datasets, visualisations, mining projects etc). Share/ask for tips suggestions and in general talk about services/tools/sites you find interesting.

Here you can rant, go off-topic, or self promote even but please be civil.

P.S: Suggestions for this subreddit are always welcome.
