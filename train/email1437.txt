Hello all, 

I have a Project to complete in r for a class at my university. Me and my group have spent hours looking for a viable dataset, but are not able to find any. I was hoping someone could help us here....

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the requirements: 

&amp;#x200B;

a. Find a data set with two variables Y,X with the following properties:

 • At least 150 observations 

• The data set should not be a time series or directly correlated with time

 • The independent variable X should be approximately evenly distributed over its range

 • The error terms should be homoscedastic

 • The data should be from economics or related topics

 • Suitable for the multiple linear regression model (no nonlinearities) 

• You may use suitable transformations to linearize a nonlinear data set (Briey describe the transformation)

 • Clear relationship between X and Y for at least 1 variable (see task b.)

&amp;#x200B;

We have already browsed through some threads and found nothing. Thank you all!
