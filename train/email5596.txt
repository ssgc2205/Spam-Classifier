I’m looking for any dataset, the more interesting the better it is.

It must have at least these 3 fields
1) Unique ID
2) Open Date
3) Close Date

Typically datasets that are good for survival analysis are good examples.

But I’m keen in finding customer support service tickets datasets if it exist. Customer can open multiple tickets, and each ticket would have varying open date and close date.
