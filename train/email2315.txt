I am looking for a product (items) dimensions dataset that contains the item's length, height, width, weight, etc. 

For example, Amazon items or products with its dimensions.

I found this one [https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) from kaggle.

Does anyone know other than this? 

Thank you
