Hello,

I'm taking an intro to processing class and we need to find a data set to produce a viz for.  I'm really enamored with geography-centric data like this [map of where people run](http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/), or the [wind map](http://hint.fm/wind/), and especially the [Texas Secession Petition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1ff5ZkdbI8).  

I was wondering if a beginner would be able to produce something of that level in a semester?  

But my main question is are there interesting data set that could produce something that analyzes something deeper?  So far I've found the [Capital Bike Share data](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) and [Metro data](http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/developer_resources.cfm), I was also thinking about color coding plot values based on assessor data and analyzing that with other metrics like grocery stores... but would that be more GIS?
