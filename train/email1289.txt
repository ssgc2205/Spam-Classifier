I’m trying to build a classifier to predict who will win an NBA game and am looking for something like “at a specific game time, the win loss ratio of this team was X”. So for example, if on Nov 1, 2018, the W/L of the Lakers was x, Id want that. Is this something available or I have to creatively engineer it?
