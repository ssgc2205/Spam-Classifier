There's plenty of large numbers out there and plenty of name-specific archives/honor rolls, but I'm looking for a dataset where I can find a single number (or multiple if broken down by service) of casualties for every day (or however many days a dataset may record) of the war. Any suggestions or advice or links would be much appreciated. I've already searched the Archives, but they don't have date-level resolution and the official DoD casualty statistics website has only macro-level data available to the public. Thank you!
