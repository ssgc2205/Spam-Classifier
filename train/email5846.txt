Sorry if this has been asked a lot here, reddit search is really bad.

Finding raw data at a national level isn't that difficult most of the time, but looking for global covid data all I get are visualizations, pre-analyzed data, and everything but raw data. On the official WHO site they didn't provide very useful data, and I've been searching for an hour but found nothing useful.

Seeing all these sites that enable you to see cases, deaths, and testing across different countries and territories, I wonder where can I find the data?

I am specifically looking for the amount of coronavirus cases, tests, recoveries, and deaths that occurred every day (or any other short interval that's shorter than a week) in a lot of countries with that data available.

I want to do some analysis with pandas and matplotlib as a fun project
