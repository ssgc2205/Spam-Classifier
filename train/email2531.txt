Hey,

the title basically says it all. I would like to have a matched dataset of highschool (or late teenage years in general) kid's intelligence (ideally subdivided into different "subcategories" of intelligence like language processing, logical-mathematical thinking, processing speed in general) and performance in school (average grade at graduation or something like this) and performance of these kids in later life in terms of success/satisfaction in the work place. 

Do you guys know if something like this exists?
