I am curious which of the world's professions donate the most to charity. 

Wall Street Bankers, Doctors, Lawyers, Actors, Programmers, etc. 

If there is a way to omit the big outliers like Bill Gates, etc. that would be the best. 

I always see actors helping people out for charity, but it makes sense because they are in the public eye, but there are plenty of people making the same amount of cash as them and doing different things to earn their money.

Which is putting in the most to help people? 

You are all amazing, I love you.
