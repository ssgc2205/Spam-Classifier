Hi there, I posted the same question in /r/semanticweb before realising this was a more active sub.

I'm doing research into Linked (Open) Data and have been struggling to find any datasets. It's, of course, entirely possible I'm just looking in the wrong places, but I can't seem to find anything which would be useful.

Thank you for reading.
