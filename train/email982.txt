I have been trying to figure out just how bad my 2017 Yamaha R3 (321cc) motorcycle is compared to the standard passenger vehicle.

The Mythbusters episode removed all doubt that the emissions are Artie Lange levels of noxious, but my various attempts at finding data have been somewhat less than successful.

I want to know if there are non-electric options that I can turn to, or at least just how many Honda Civics it would take to match my greenhouse crime spree.   

To be honest, I was a little surprised that I didn't immediately find a resource for this information.
