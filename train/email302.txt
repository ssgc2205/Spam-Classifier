 

How to find monthly google searches for a specific keyword I have seen people say to use google keywords planner but that needs an AD Campaign I am looking for something else which is free

I just want to make something like the most popular anime from the last 10 years for just a fun side project, the video on youtube which you can find by searching "Most popular anime from 2004-2020"(Subreddit doesn't allow links) has instructions on how he did it in the description but I am unable to find it Thanks
