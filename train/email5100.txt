I have collected Taxi Trip data for the cities of Chicago and NYC.

These are links to the datasets in case youâ€™re looking for them:

[Chicago Taxi Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)

I was hoping to get a similar dataset for a few other cities. In particular I was interested in San Francisco, Toronto and London but any city will be greatly appreciated!
