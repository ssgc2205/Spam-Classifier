hey guys,

I want a dataset that contains a big amount of news headlines along with their sentiment ( whether it is a positive or. negative news).

If it is labeled by human it is better but I can't seem to find one on the internet.

I found one which had like 1000 news and one that had 10,000 news but was labeled using Vadar so it wasn't labeled by humans or at least a more trustable algorithm.
