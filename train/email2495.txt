In case you didn't see the [introduction thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/4x5v4s/introducing_the_rdatasets_sidebar_series_official/), /r/datasets is starting a sidebar series! Every week or so I'll post another mega thread on a different topic.

Use this thread to post every Electionand Political Poll Data source you know of. I made this the first sidebar series thread as it's relevant to our 2016 elections, but please feel free to post data for other election, other years, and other countries.

Here's to a successful sidebar series!
