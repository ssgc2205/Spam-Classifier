I'm going to do this research about predicting review rating of some product. I am thinking movie review seems like an interesting problem. But I haven't found the dataset I need yet (obviously I need the number rating and the text review of the movies). 

[Movie Lens dataset] (http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens) only provides the number rating without the full text review. [The Rotten Tomatoes dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews) is quite close to what I need, but the labels seem to be leaning more on sentiment analysis, instead of the actual number rating. I looked up IMDb API, but apparently they don't have open API. Can someone give me any suggestion? I am sorry if I am not being really clear (just ask me away), I hope I don't violate any rule.
