I am trying to improve my knowledge with in text mining and NLP. Therefore I am looking for a dataset with, for example, text input from patient on their symptoms (or similar). My goal is to find key words, i.e. the symptoms and cluster patients based on their symtoms.

Edit: I am extending the question as I am more interested in the process than the results. Is there any dataset that has the same characteristics?
