Hello everyone,

I'm looking for any industrial dataset and can't find anything online. Hoping someone could point me in the right direction.

I'm looking for data that has to do with process control, chemical processes, wind turbine output data, combined cycle power plants. Any industrial nonlinear system will work just fine. 

I came across a dataset from UCI from a combined cycle power generation but unfortunately,  the data has been previously shuffled and the data is not sufficient to train my model. 


Have an awesome Sunday, everyone!
