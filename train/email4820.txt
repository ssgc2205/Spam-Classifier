I'm looking for datasets on US banks' derivative portfolio.  
I have worked with the Call Reports ([https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/)) that are public, quarterly data on banks' financials (including derivatives).  
Is there any other dataset available (not necessarily free) on US banks' balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions?
