Hi everyone!

My name's Christian, and I'd like to share what we've been building at [OrgStack](https://orgstack.io/).  I'm posting this here as a "request for feedback" from the community that we serve.

Poor data quality is a costly problem for many organizations.  Invalid data is responsible for major product/service outages, and it can be very  difficult to pinpoint the root cause of data-related incidents.  This requires a large investment of engineering resources.

OrgStack aims to streamline the process of managing data sources, receiving critical alerts, and tracing incidents to their source.  While building a solution to this problem, we drew inspiration from some of our favorite tools, including NPM, Loggly, and Jenkins.

A few baseline questions:

* Is data validation / data quality currently a problem for you?
* How do you solve it now?
* Which differentiating features would get you to switch?
* What would your ideal solution look like?

Thanks in advance for your feedback.  We really appreciate it!
