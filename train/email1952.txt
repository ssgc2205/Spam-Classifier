Hello everyone, I am a university researcher with background in cognitive science working on semantic distance between words.

I come to you after having spent multiple days trying to figure out how to use the Common Crawl database implemented through word2vec using Gensim. I have basic familiarity with computers and java programming but I have never used GitHub or tools like word2vec, which takes a database of text (such as googleNews, or Wikipedia, or CommonCrawl which is GB of text data from the internet) and can give you the cosine semantic distance between 2 words.

For example "man" and "woman" might have a coefficient of 0.8 but "water" and "jealousy" might have a coefficient of 0.15 because they are rarely used in the same context.

Has anyone successfully used word2vec on their Mac? I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make it work. From what I understand these are the steps I need to take, some of which I already have:

1. Install Python

This I did

2) Install Pip

This I did by running the following in my terminal:

$ Sudo easy\_install pip

$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setup tools wheel

3) Install Gensim

This I did by running the following in my terminal:

$ pip install --upgrade gensim

4) Install Word2vec and train it on Common Crawl as its corpus

Cant figure it out!!
