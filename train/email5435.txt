Im looking for a video dataset with (ideally) people performing some of the following actions:

\- walking

\- running

\- Punching / smashing

\- Looking in a car

\- Crouching 

I have found some on kaggle and other websites but im wondering if the people here know of any that i may not know about or have looked over. Any help is greatly appreciated.
