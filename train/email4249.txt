Felt-presence experiences and bodily disturbances are two common phenomena experienced widely in the general global population.

A felt-presence experience is a feeling or sense that another entity, individual, or being is present despite no clear sensory or perceptual evidence.

A bodily disturbance can be any number of strange, or inexplicable sensations originating in the body, including "out of body" and dissociative experiences.

Although many people around the world who experience these phenomena is high, information about these types of experiences has been relatively limited.

Please consider taking our anonymous, confidential online survey (Vanderbilt University IRB exempt status #212181) to help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of what these experiences look, feel, sound, or even smell like. The survey link is here: [https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=7WM7HL399CAP8XXT](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=7WM7HL399CAP8XXT)

The survey is broken up into three parts: the Introductory Survey (Part One, linked above), Felt Presence Experience (Part Two), and Self, Body, and Emotions (Part Three). After completing Part One, you will be automatically redirected to a Linktree page, where you can access the other Parts of the survey. Please take as many parts as you wish or as feel relevant to you.
