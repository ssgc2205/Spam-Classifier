Hi everyone,

I'm stuck trying to figure out a way to create a dataset of car images where the images are the features and the labels are the angles at which the images were shot.

For example, if we can only see the back of the car, then the feature is the image of the back of the car and the label \`back\` (or something like that).

I have searched for something like that but the closest thing I could find is the cars-196 dataset which its labels are the make,model and year of the car.

Links to relevant dataset/papers/methodologies that will help me obtain/generate that dataset are more than welcome!

Thanks!!!
