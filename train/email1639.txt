Show off, complain, and generally have a chat about data here.    
Discuss whatever you've been playing with lately(datasets, visualisations, mining projects etc).   
Also feel free to share/ask for tips suggestions and in general talk about services/tools/sites you find interesting.

The first one was a flop so if you think this is a good/bad idea, please let us know.

P.S: Suggestions for this subreddit are welcome.
