Hello,
I'm currently working on my master thesis in which i focus on big data solutions (SAP HANA in particular). I am in need of a decently sized (preferably few milion rows in fact table) data sample with some sort of transactional data for development of a business scenario. Preferably something related to retail since that's what I'm most familiar with. 

I've been trying to find some sort of sample set for quite some time, yet most of them are not available publicly / contain small sample sizes. Vertica's sample (https://my.vertica.com/docs/4.1/HTML/Master/1833.htm) is more or less what I'm looking for, sadly it's not available to public.

I'm looking for something containing huge fact table along with few dimension tables. Any help/tips will be appreciated.
