Hi guys, first time posting here. I am looking for snapshots for any ResNet trained on ImageNet, but with the snapshot (in PyTorch ideally) saved over many epochs. For example, if the training took around 300 epochs, is there a google drive / github link which has snapshots of the network every 10-50 epochs (e.g., about 6-20 snapshots over the course of training). If anybody knows where I could get this that would be extremely helpful!!! Thanks in advance :)
