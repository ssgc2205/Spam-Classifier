I need to perform some machine learning algorithms on a data set that contains cloud providers' performance. I need some of the following information : availability, input/output per second, max restore time, processing time, latency with internal compute resource,...
I'm already simulating this data, but I need data of real cloud providers and for some users in long time. Few numbers that show the average of those metrics won't do. I need a detailed and large data set. Is there a chance that any company provides such data?
