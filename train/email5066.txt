Hi, I'm new here. I have been trying to find some study that gives a comprehensive list of infections that make you more susceptible to other infections due to weakened immune response, for example bacterial pneumonia after a viral upper respiratory infection. I know this may be a very specialized thing and maybe  there is some other subreddit that I could ask this on, so please guide me to that. Thanks!
