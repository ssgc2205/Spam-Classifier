I am looking for a website that provides parseable Cricket commentary data. The fields I am looking for are:

* Bowler
* Batsman
* Run/No Run
* Short Type(Drive, Pull, Hook etc)
* Placement (On, Silly Mid-ob etc)
* Delivery(Yorker, Bouncer etc).

For instance, CT Final Between IND v PAK, commentary of delivery is:

&gt;Fakhar Zaman to Pandya, 1 run, dollied up full and straight, Pandya leans on a punch down the ground to long-on (Ref: CricInfo). So fields here are:

* Bowler: Pandya
* Batsman:- Fakhar Zaman
* Run/No Run:- 1
* Short Type(Drive, Pull, Hook etc): n/A
* Placement (On, Silly Midon etc):- Long-ON
* Delivery(Yorker, Bouncer etc). Full Toss.

(Source: [CT 2018 Final](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8037/commentary/1022375/india-vs-pakistan-final-icc-champions-trophy-2017))

Basically I am interested to know what shot played by a batsman when a bowler delivered a certain ball and how many runs were made.

Thanks
