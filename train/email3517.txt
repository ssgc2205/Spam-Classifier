Hi, I am working on a database project for school and wanted to make a flight database that would allow for some niche search parameters that I think most travel websites do not have. So I would like to collect the flight data such as departure airport, destination airport, time, current cost of tickets. 

Ideally, this dataset already exists, but if not tips on how to go about scraping would be appreciated. I posted in /r/opendata but thought here might be more appropriate.
