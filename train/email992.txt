I am working on a project that uses ngrams and vectorization to do name matching. I have a list of random financial institution names (about 50k) and I would like to match these names against a dictionary of companies. I have been using the government consumer complaints data dump and it works decently well, however, I'm curious if there is another source to find a list of unique financial institution names. This includes companies like,

* Mortgage Lenders
* Credit Card Companies
* Banks
