Hi /r/datasets!

&amp;#x200B;

As part of my master's studies we have to analyze a dataset from an organization in Tableau. I've looked around on Kaggle, but there does not seem to be any (?) organizational data on there. 

Do you guys know of any datasets, websites, or other places where I could acquire such data? Apologies is this questions has been asked already, I couldn't find anything through Google or using the search function on Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!
