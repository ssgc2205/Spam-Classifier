Hey guys, I'm new to this subreddit. I've been looking all over for a shipping data set that contains at least these things, United States domestic, county of origin, county of destination, truck type/class, truck weight, and miles driven. I've been looking everywhere for a data set like this. Are there any suggestions on obscure places I may have missed or a set somebody may have posted in the past? I'd really appreciate any help.
