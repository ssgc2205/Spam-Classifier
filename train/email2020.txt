I've been in Dallas 3 yrs now and it's time to GTFO. 

I'm looking for data in csv format for city and states that includes income, sales, and property tax, crime, cost of living, inflation, general demographics, population +/-, climate (weather &amp; political), amenities/attractions, retirement feasibility. 

I know this is a long list, but there is more ðŸ˜†. Any guidance to real and recent data would be awesome. 

Thanks in advance!
