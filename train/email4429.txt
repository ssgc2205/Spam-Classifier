The list **includes** redirects and disambiguation pages, so a decent number of them aren't actually articles. It was compiled by scraping this list: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:AllPages

The urls are new-line delimited. Note that each url doesn't include the `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/` part. So `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People` is simply listed as `People`.
