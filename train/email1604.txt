Does anyone have these or know where I can get them? I've been to the organizations webpage where the files are corrupted. I checked data.gov, which is not functional as part of the government shutdown. I tried google and google scholar. Any ideas or help is greatly appreciated. This is for my research paper for my Masters degree. Thank you.
