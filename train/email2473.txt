Hi everybody.

I just coded a Scrapy python project to crawl famous dictionaries (Oxford, Longman, Cambridge, Webster, and Collins), it is on my Github:

[https://github.com/kiasar/Dictionary\_crawler](https://github.com/kiasar/Dictionary_crawler)

&amp;#x200B;

with this, you can create a lot of dictionary data if you want to.

Hope you like it.
