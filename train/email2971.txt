Does anyone know any good datasets for activity detection and recognition. We are working on a project where we want to reduce the size of videos a cctv capture. We want to do this by only recording footage of anomalous events like fighting, stealing, accidents etc.

I've found the activity net dataset but this does not contain anomalous events. Can you please share any datasets for activity detection and recognition which contains anomalous events. Thanks!
