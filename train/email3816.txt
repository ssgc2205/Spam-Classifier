I’m interested in addresses, but not pristine data.  I’m looking for data including potential typos, misplaced punctuation, transpositions, inconsistent capitalization etc.  It would also be nice if the data were in the public domain or available under a CC NC-BY or similar license.  I have looked at data.gov and other data providers ([for example](https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/db09ac12-9671-4c6a-9200-1ddbe658329d/resource/45a51d58-8846-4297-9311-bea10876e019/download/2016-second-quarter-nuisance-calls.csv)), but most address data sets I’ve come across have been cleaned/normalized so they are not exactly what I’m after.
