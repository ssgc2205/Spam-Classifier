Hello, I find myself in need of an open dataset containing a lot of universities and research institutions, more info is a plus but not a necessity, where can I find something like this, does it even exist(I would be surprised if it didn't)?I have found a couple, mainly the World Higher Education Database, but its proprietary(only free basic searching).I was thinking of  maybe scraping LinkedIn or WHED but I think they wouldn't like that.Any help  would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!
