Folks, how are you and your data teams impacted in the current situation? Has the "remote" transition been easy? While my team is working hard with IT/admin to resolve their access issues + tool/tech setup, I was wondering if you had any useful tips, challenges you faced or learnings you'd like to share? Would appreciate inputs on how intangible elements like collaboration, productivity/agility could likely be impacted...
