So I've been searching quite a while for a big list where typical business hours for different countries are available.  
I'm not referring to annual working hours, but rather the time your average office employee is usually considered to be working, e. g. the famous "nine to five" for most Western countries. I'm aware that outliers exist but in my country for instance, early birds start working at 7, the late ones usually leave at about 5. Sure, some may start at 6, some may leave at 7, but those aren't the norm in an office setting.  
If deviating break habits, such as the infamous Spanish siesta, are covered as well - even better.  
Thank you in advance.
