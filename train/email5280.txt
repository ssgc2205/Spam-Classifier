Hey r/datasets!

I'm looking for data on American automobile prices in the early 20th century, specifically around 1900 to 1930. Ideally it would be a yearly catalog where I can compare how prices changed for specific car models over time.

I'm also hoping to find information about injuries and deaths per passenger mile over this period as well.

Thanks!
