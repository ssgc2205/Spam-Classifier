I'm just starting out with working with datasets and could use a little guidance setting this one up. I'm trying to download this dataset here so I can do some basic analysis practice using python on it:

https://gisdata-njdep.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/njdep::ambient-metals-of-new-jersey/explore?location=40.253850%2C-74.705250%2C8.13&amp;showTable=true

But when I go to the download table and choose CSV, the subsequent excel file has the column headers for the various metals are the attribute labels I see in the metadata and not the attribute definition. For example instead of "Chromium Dissolved as Cr (µg/L)", it says P01030. I'm assuming this has something to do with the µ character when downloading the CSV, but I'm not sure the best way around it. I figure CSV isn't the best type of file for this type of mapping data, but I'm not sure the best way to go from here. I can't downloaded it from arcGIS website either without an account which I'd rather not pay for. Is there a way to format it after you have downloaded it to reassign the attribute definitions? Or is that kind of lost in the download? Is the fastest way to just manually type them in? Thanks for the help
