Hello everyone! Iâ€™m currently working on the marketing sector of an e-commerce company and would like do compare great anime franchises with some Blockbuster cinema franchises like Harry Potter, Marvel and so on. I would like to compare them with data on revenue, all-time audience, growing audience and so on so the more complete the dataset the better. Does anyone knows where i can get this information? Thanks in advance!
