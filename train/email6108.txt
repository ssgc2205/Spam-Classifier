Currently working on my dissertation about first impressions of bodies and looking for a set that contains full body pictures of real men and women standing in a neutral pose (hands by sides, not walking, etc) preferably in front of a white background. Does this exist? Should I be using certain search terms or a specific site that houses model pictures? All recommendations are welcome!
Thanks
