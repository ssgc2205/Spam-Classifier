Just created an API that allows you to find how many pornstars are in each country and how many pornstars per million inhabitants the country has.

Endpoints:

- https://api.pornstars-per-capita.com - brief documentation of endpoints
- https://api.pornstars-per-capita.com/countries - list of all countries with population, pornstar count and pornstars per million, can be filtered and sorted
- https://api.pornstars-per-capita.com/countries/{countryName} - data for only one country, the data are the same is in `/countries` endpoint
- https://api.pornstars-per-capita.com/countries/links - list of all countries with links to the detail endpoint
- https://api.pornstars-per-capita.com/regions - list of regions (Europe, Asia etc.) with population, pornstar count and pornstars per million
- https://api.pornstars-per-capita.com/sources - describes sources used for the data

Notes:

- there are no official pornstar registries so the data will never be exact, if you know better sources I would welcome your comments
- pretty much the same is true for population data, it's always an approximation, again if you know better sources, let me know
