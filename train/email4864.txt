Many bitcoin addresses have known labels (such as found on walletexplorer.com), have appeared as owned on some forum or otherwise or even have been identified by law enforcement agencies.

Does anyone know of any, even incomplete, lists of bitcoin addresses (or other cryptocurrencies) and their known owner or annotated additional meaning?
