Hey

Looking for a dataset of actors who have starred in remakes of other movies.

The dataset I am looking for would have information of -

- name of actor in the remake 
-  name of movie (remake) 
-  name of the actor in the original movie 
- name of the original movie

Preferably Hollywood.

I am aware of IMDB dataset, though I don't know how to filter the entire dataset just for movie remakes.

Any ideas?
