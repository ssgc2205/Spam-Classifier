Hello,

Would anyone be kind enough to help a student out with a list of legal technology companies filtered by | Name; website; email; phone; comments | ?

I’ve managed to gather around 400 items, but it’s just frustrating to know there are better ways to do it.

I’m ready to barter for the list if need be, but ...

Am eager to see replies.
