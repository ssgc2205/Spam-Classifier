Hi, I'm starting to get into this beautiful world of data and I can't understand where does everything come from. I have seen many "data comparison videos throughout the time" where they show loads of data that does not have any source.  


What is a good place to get data from?

I'm aiming to have data of multiple stuff throughout the time, trying to do some cool stuff with it, but don't have any source to get that from.  


Thanks!
