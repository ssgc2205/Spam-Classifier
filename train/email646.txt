I'm looking for a data set of instances of U.S. Politicians being paid for speaking engagements. I'd like to create a visualization of who is speaking, when, for how much, and who is paying.

example data available here: http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-paid-speeches/
