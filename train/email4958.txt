I need to extract the triplets from a given utterance of a conversation. 

For example, I dislike rainy weather.  Triplets ==&gt; (Person1, dislikes, Rainy Weather). 

I basically need to extract structured data from conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

The first task is determining the domain of the sentence (like Weather, Sports, Politics, Hobbies, Music, Movies, Profession, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone point me the resources to get the corresponding dataset. (i,.e, Sentences related to preferences)
