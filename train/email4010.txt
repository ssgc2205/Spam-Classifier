I've seen various examples of such datasets [e.g. Correlates of War], though they either don't appear to be geotagged, or *are* geotagged but don't go back far enough in history.

My ideal dataset would something that begins somewhere around the year 1000 AD and ends in 2018 AD, and is either already geotagged, or has the battle location down to a city/state level . (so I can do geotagging myself).  

[This Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_by_casualties) actually has everything I need (battle location *and* casualty figures), however, the data is semi-unstructured and would require some extensive and pretty messy web scraping that I don't really want to get involved in. 

Would much appreciate any ideas.
