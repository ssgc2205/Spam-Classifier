*"A data set (or dataset, although this spelling is not present in many contemporary dictionaries like Merriam-Webster) is a collection of data. ... The term data set may also be used more loosely, to refer to the data in a collection of closely related tables, corresponding to a particular experiment or event."*

So would you write 'dataset' or 'data set' on your resume?
