... maybe not quiet but it seems that way. Here's the story: 

I am a cyclist, trying to do between 150 and 200km per week.
Since joining a site that evaluates all my power, heart rate data etc. I am being targeted by a Health insurance company for cyclists. 
One of their statements is that cyclists have a 

*28% lower risk of all-cause mortality*.

I've tried to look up the definition of "all-cause mortality" and it just does not make any sense to me. Surely they are not saying that I have an 28% chance of living forever. I've checked with a friend who is a doctor and one who sells insurance and neither could help. The website does not seem to quote any scientific articles that support this bold claim. 

So I am trying to find: 

* The evidence that this specific claim is based on. Failing that I'd be keen on
* finding an understandable definition of 'all cause mortality'
* finding similar research that considers the risks and benefits of cycling or sports in general, as I'm certain there are some significant health issues.
