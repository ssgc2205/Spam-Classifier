I'm just kicking off this project with a friend. I've spent 4 years in the personal data space and he's spent 5 years on security teams. 

Thoughts from supporters, users, critics would be great.

1. Verifiable by sharing sites scanned, info found, and aggregate progress / improvement
2. Doesn’t claim to secure accounts that already have large security teams and privacy settings settings
3. Free
4. Actionable so you can request information be taken down, report incidences to the government, participate in class action claims, know if a site re-posts information it shouldn’t
5. Works with minimal information like email
