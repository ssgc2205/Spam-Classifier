Hello, I am looking for a dataset that includes every area code in the United States, and the major city/state matching each values. For example, if you go to this site ([here](http://www.allareacodes.com/reverse-phone-lookup/) ) and search for an area code, it returns the major city associated with it. I am creating an application that will include this feature (site mentioned earlier does not allow redistribution), so I will need the ability to redistribute it, please. I have found this dataset ([here](http://www.convertit.com/Go/ConvertIt/Reference/Telephone_Area_Codes.ASP) );however, I contacted the site and they said it's extremely old/out of date. I appreciate any help, thank you very much!
