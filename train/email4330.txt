# [py_ball](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/py_ball)

Introducing py_ball, a Python API wrapper for the stats.nba.com and data.wnba.com APIs with a focus on NBA and WNBA applications. You can download the module with the link above or [here](https://pypi.org/project/py-ball/).

There are similar tools out there for accessing and analyzing basketball data, but py_ball adds both documentation ([here](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/py_ball/wiki) and [here](https://basketballrelativity.github.io/py_ball/_build/html/index.html)) along with a wide array of tutorials to make basketball analytics both accessible and approachable.
