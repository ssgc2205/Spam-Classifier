I’m an absolute beginner and I’m being asked to find a research topic for a college course on data analysis using Excel. 

One subject I’m interested in is vaccine refusal in wealthy countries, specifically the US, but could be anywhere if the dataset is good and bountiful. 

I’m finding lots of data on world vaccination rates but not data that can specifically tell me about vaccine refusal and it’s effects. 

If anyone has any thoughts to share or would like to direct me to some data on this, I’ll be eternally grateful.
