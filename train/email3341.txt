What are the legal aspects of publishing a dataset made of news articles scraped from a website?
I know the author (or copyright owner) can act against someone who reproduces his work without express permission, but in this case there are some differences:
1. Articles won't be totally republished (images and embedded videos and other such things won't be added to the dataset),
2. Articles won't be immediately usable from the general public as they will be serialized in json or csv format, and will not be organized in a way that makes searching for a specific article easy
3. There won't be promotion of the content or any form of profit from it
4. The source will be credited
5. The dataset will be made public with the sole intent of research (and points 2 and 3 might further indicate this).

Is there a chance I don't end up with a lot of debts to pay if I do it?
