I'm looking for a dataset which contains sql schema definitions together with their description. Does something like this exists?

`CREATE TABLE Persons
(
PersonID int,
LastName varchar(255),
FirstName varchar(255),
Address varchar(255),Â 
City varchar(255) 
);

Description:
A person has an id, last name, first name, an address, city
