All the APIs I seem to find are either overkill or don't have all the currencies I need; I only need to download a data set, which doesn't need to be perfectly accurate, daily, even weekly, on a base currency (dollar or euro) for all the other 170 something currencies in the world.

The only real contenders I've found are these guys, [https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/](https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/) but their API is not that great for my needs, and I can't even test their free version because of that, and I wonder where do they get their data? surely the financial data for currency exchanges must be available somewhere.
