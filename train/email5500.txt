With the impending shutdown of Yahoo Answers, I was wondering if anyone on here has tried pulling down as complete a dataset of Yahoo Answers as possible? I don't just mean the best questions answers, I mean all the answers, including the most insane awful answers and the worst questions people put together.

I found a 300MB gzip that was fairly extensive from 2015 with about 1.4m rows, but I'm wondering if anyone has put together an even more extensive dataset.

Here's the 300MB one. It has info on the people who initially put it together as well:
