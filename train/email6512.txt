Im trying to make a model that recognizes full trashcans (from above or next to the can), or rather can distinguish them from full ones.
Its pretty easy to  find data on just general trash detection (e.g. "paper" "can" etc.).


I also found trashcan detection for Philadelphia but I think one could easily reuse the code/the model the person made to reproduce the same for other cities
