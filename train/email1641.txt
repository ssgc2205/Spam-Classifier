I have created a torrent for the Reddit comment dataset (based on the downloads /u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix has made available at http://files.pushshift.io/comments/ ). This includes the files from 2007-10 to 2016-04.

Hope this works as intended.

Note: I found that one of the files was corrupted, either during original download or re-upload. You can download it directly here:
