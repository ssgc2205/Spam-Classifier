For adaptive optics, real or artificial guide stars are tracked, indicating disturbances from the atmosphere.  I'd like either a high speed (khz at least) video of a star so that I can find the center and track it myself, or the position data already  calculated. I'm trying to  find out about how much beams coming in through the atmosphere wander and at what frequencies. Analysis is not a problem, I just can't find the data. The next step is to start contacting observatories directly, as someone is probably recording this. Thanks!
