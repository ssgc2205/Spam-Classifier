I would like to have a better understanding of how individual tax revenue can be broken down by income level. I know there is an expensive dataset out there that one can buy for something like $4400 / record year, but contains more data than I really need. For example, it would be nice to have a breakdown of how many returns fell into each of the tax brackets, organized by single, married filing jointly, and married filing separately. Does anyone know where I can find that information?
