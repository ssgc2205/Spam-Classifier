Hi,

Has anyone a clue where I could get data about world energy consumption since the 1800s? I'd like to see how energy needs have exploded since the exploration of fossil fuels and (preferably) how the energy mix changed.

Wikipedia gives a nice chart (first figure), but it doesnt go further back than 1965: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption

Thanks
