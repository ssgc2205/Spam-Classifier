Hey,

I'm a CS student, and I have a homework in which I have to analyse an irregular / unevenly spaced time series.
I've only been able to find the Missing Migrants set, but it's not ideal to demonstrate a trend or seasonality.

Do you know any irregular time series I could use?

Thanks in advance!
