Luigi Pascali has created a remarkable group of data on international trade, creating a natural experiment on the discontinuity between trade by sail -- which limited routes to the winds-- and the coming of the steamship. Pascali is specifically measuring some of the particular impacts of trade to economic historians, but this data has many other potential uses.
