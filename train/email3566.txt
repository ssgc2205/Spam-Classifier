I am looking for syslog data from Cisco devices including firewalls, routers, switches, and Intrusion Prevention/Detection Systems (IPDS) that we can run through the tool that we are developing. 

The demonstration will simulate that data is being monitored and ingested through the tools data flow. The tool will read the syslog data and determine weather it is a threat (based on set rules) and then either store the file in an archive no further action required or generate a report for the analyst or send an immediate alert.

If anyone know where  can find this kind of sample, Thank You in advance.
