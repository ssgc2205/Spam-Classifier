I want to work on an NLP project, preferably in finance domain. For that, I am trying to search for any available dataset/documents which I can analyze and come up with some interesting results. Any ideas where I can find such a dataset and what finance-related problems I can look into?

P.S. I have looked kaggle, but could not find a dataset which has documents to work on a finance domain-related task.
