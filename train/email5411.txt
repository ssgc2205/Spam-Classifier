Just like SQUAD2.0 dataset I am looking for a dataset that has product review and selected text from the review that describes about the product. For example:

|Text|selected\_text|
|:-|:-|
|The car is made up of plastic and the logo written is hotcart wheels, this is not a hot wheels|made up of plastic; logo written is hotcart wheels; this is not a hot wheels|

Note:  I am not looking for **text summarization dataset** like a review is given and what it actually means, please don't get confused with this.
