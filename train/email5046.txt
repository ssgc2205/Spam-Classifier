* [Global Database](https://www.globaldatabase.com/our-data) \- from my personal standpoint I consider that this is the most innovative platform nowadays, offering unlimited downloading of the contacts (company and executive profiles) over the world without any additional costs and allow integration with CRM, App, and Marketing Automation tools. Through filters, you can find exact contacts (employee and companies profiles) filter by industry, location, company revenue/size, seniority level (CEO, CXO, director, manager…).

As a suggestion, the faster and better way to find a provider is to request a free trial on the company’s website, thus you will have a clearer image about the quality of the platform, how this is working, being able to evaluate customer experience when an agent will show the platform and also you will ask whatever question, analyzing the transparency of the company.

Good luck!
