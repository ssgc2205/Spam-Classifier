Looking for a dataset of publicly traded companies, and their employee counts. Employee counts could be estimated, and we are specifically looking for companies with less than 500 employees.

The dataset is going to be used to calculate the benefit each company is going to receive from the CARES Act, if youâ€™re catchin my drift.

Thank you!
