Hi, what I'm looking for is pretty simple but I've been unable to get to it. I want to do a bit of a cohort analysis on covid cases. I want to know what percentage of daily covid cases are occurring among the:

* unvaccinated
* post dose 1
* post dose 2
* post dose 3
* etc..

Ideally for the UK. Thanks
