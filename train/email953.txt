Hi,

Is it possible to access order book info for a given stock for free?

I'm reading an article that uses the following infofor trades:

Datetime
Type (Bid, Ask, Trade)
Price
Size
qBid
Bid Price
qAsk
Ask Price

I'd like to find similar data to recreate the paper for Apple stock. Any ideas where I could find this? The paper claims it was obtained from Bloomberg but when I search for stock I for there, I just can find open and close prices. I'm not a finance person - can anyone help please?
