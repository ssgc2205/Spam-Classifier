  
hello all!  
i am currently doing an analysis of the data is beautiful subreddit over at r/dataisbeautiful for my BA of Media and was hoping to access some sort of dataset about it  


i was looking to see if anyone had crawled the subreddit before, or is willing to do it, to gather various data about the community 

&amp;#x200B;

i was hoping for some data about how many people post in a certain time frame and the engagement of posts, or just any data that could be useful for analysing the way that people interact in the subreddit 

&amp;#x200B;

this would be extremely useful, thank you!
