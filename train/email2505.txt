Hi all,

I am doing research on sexuality and gender in the gaming community on Reddit and 4chan. As part of this research I am hoping to collect the past year worth of comments data from /r/gaming. Can anyone provide any advice about whether this is possible, and how I might go about it? In particular, it would be ideal to collect comments data from posts that are in the 'controversial' category.

Thanks in advance.
