This list has 661,219 business entities, many of which are clearly interconnected or franchises. Information does include business demographics such as business registration type and if it is a minority or veteran owned business. The loan amount is expressed as a range. It does NOT include the name of the principle owner or applicant.

UPDATE: Some banks have already sold their loan portfolios to other banks or loan servicing companies, such as The Loan Source Inc. If you are looking at how much banks profited from servicing and selling PPP loans, one analyst suggested a 1.5% return.
