Hi all first time posting, I’m attempting to find a dataset that includes information on NBA player stats for each game this season. So basically every player’s stats for every game they played including the team they played etc. I’ve checked Basketball Reference and they have all of the data available but don’t want to go through thousands of manual downloads, any advice or suggestions?
