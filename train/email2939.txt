2 years ago there was a Game Data Mining Competition organized by NCSOFT. The data was 100GB of game logs from 10.000 players. The competition website is no longer active ([https://cilab.sejong.ac.kr/gdmc2017/](https://cilab.sejong.ac.kr/gdmc2017/)) and I cannot find this dataset anywhere. The papers from the teams that participated look interesting and I would like to replicate some of those results.
