Hey everyone. Im looking for an shp file that contains the layout of bangalore city. I have seen few topography maps out here and i was wondering if someone could pass the shp file to me as im working on a project that requires an shp file to display the spread of data across bangalore map. 

It would be really helpful as im finding shps online but it doesnt specify the actual names of parts of bangalore. Please help!
