 Hey all, I'm working on a personal project dealing with Golf Betting Odds. I was wondering if anyone has done a similar project and would be willing to either provide me with their raw data or provide me with some sources where I could scrape the data. I'm essentially looking for each players performance by round at each tournament and, ideally, the live betting odds (or at least the odds at the end of each round). If anyone could help me find this information, that would be much appreciated!
