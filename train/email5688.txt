 I am currently taking an Econometrics course and want to do some research on Bitcoin as a Hedge against inflation. I would like to start by doing a literature review, but unfortunately I'm having trouble finding research papers on the topic. Would anyone happen to know of any paper on the topic. It doesn't matter if they end up agreeing or disagreeing, but as long as they address and investigate the issue using some sort of econometric model. Any help would be appreciated.
