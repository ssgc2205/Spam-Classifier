I'm looking for a data that may have the following properties

* Number of citations of marijuana-related offenses 
* Incarceration rates for marijuana-related offenses
* Race/ethnicity of 'offender'

I realize that this really depends on the state, as some would classify it as a narcotic (and thus a CRIME) while others have decriminalized it rendering it a misdemeanor or nothing at all. 

I've not used crime data before, so please comment if I could ask the question better.
