Hi folks, is anyone aware of any datasets related to the Morton Cranial Collection that is housed at the Penn Museum?  I am not very interested in Morton's original (potentially flawed) measurements, but rather I'd be interested if modern researchers have collected data and conducted new analysis on the skulls in the collection.  Thanks.
