I'm volunteering with a non profit that helps small businesses - we are finding it hard to reach them. Is there a place where I can get data on small businesses (nail salons, food trucks, locksmiths etc) in NYC? If possible, along with revenue details (so we can decide who to get in touch)? We might be able to spend some money, not much. However, I don't mind spending time (cleaning up the data etc)

Edit: Another important data point would be the year in which the business was started
