I have this theory that global warming is caused more by the constant substitution of forests and grass for roads and concrete (considering that concrete heats up way more than grass). I really want to put this theory to the test by comparing heat and Km of concrete/road, in time series, and for various cities or countries. But I can't find datasets for the concrete part, anyone knows one?
