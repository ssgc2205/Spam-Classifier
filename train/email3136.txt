Hi! I'm curious about how many many times an airline overbooks a flight. I've found an ASC file, however, there is little to no about of the data given in the file. Does anyone know where I can find a better dataset with better documentation and/or granulator data? The file found is located here: [https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/db20](https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/db20)
