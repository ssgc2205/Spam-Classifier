I need a marketing or CRM dataset for use with a software demo.

Fields like :

Account

Contact Info (several)

Sales/Transactions

... perhaps in separate files.

Ideally it is a real dataset, not synthetic, and has some light customer detail/segment info in it. The main purpose is to measure some of the patterns that may exist in the data.

It can be an old dataset, and the product sold can be really anything.

I'm willing to pay for it but I need to be able to use it in product demos. Thank you in advance.
