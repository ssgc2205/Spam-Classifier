Hi guys,

I'm a data science student and I'm looking for datasets of tweets with a classification "factual tweets vs non factual tweets". I only find classifications of positive or negative feelings.

If you have any idea where I can find a data set like this, I'm interested.

Thank you in advance and have a nice day !
