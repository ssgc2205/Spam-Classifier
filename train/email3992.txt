I'd like to download (preferrably in excel file) statistics from **Austria for the whole last year** (if possible) for 3 sources:  


1. Number of daily new cases
2. Number of daily tests
3. Number of daily new patients in intensive care

Please help me, I am a total beginner when it comes to LOOKING for these types of data.  


I was able to find this link but I have no idea where and how to download Austria specific data:
