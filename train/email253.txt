Hey everyone,

I'm looking for a dataset that has game by game line-ups for teams across Europe over many years. So for example;

Date Team Home Team Away Team GF GA GD Player 1 Player 2...
4/25/2016 Spurs Spurs WBA 1 1 0 Lloris Vertonghen...
4/25/2016 WBA Spurs WBA 1 1 0 Myhill Evans...

Where each game is represented from each team's point of view. Does anyone know if one exists or will I have to scalp the data online?
