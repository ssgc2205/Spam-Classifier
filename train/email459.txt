Hey all, first off thanks for reading this post!  Secondly, I am trying to find data around enrollment or graduation rates by major or area of study over time.  What I would love to see overall is how student interest in humanities disciplines has compared to preprofessional programs over the last 50 years or so.  I dont need a very specific dataset and am entirely capable cleaning data but other than data from individual schools, I havent found a good aggregated dataset.

Thanks for any guidance you can offer!
