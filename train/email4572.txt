I thought I've seen this before, I thought there was a publicly displayed list of companies and demands they got from ransomware? (I realize most don't disclose) but, if there is something similar somewhere? I don't really need company names, but more sizes of companies, or values of companies, which I would use the name to try to find, so with size or value of the company, it stays anonymous and makes less work for me actually.   Any ideas?
