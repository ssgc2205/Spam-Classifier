Hello, 

I got into an argument about height discrimination with a friend.

He claims height discrimination is grossly exaggerated. The data is skewed by basketball players (and any industry where tall people legitimately have an advantage).

&amp;nbsp;

I countered: if that is true, then Silicon Valley (the tech sector) should show no income discrepancy. Since there's no advantage being a tall programmer.
And if I can find data showing there still is an income discrepancy. Then his theory is disproven. He agreed.

&amp;nbsp;

Can someone direct me to where I can find this kind of data?

Height vs Income in tech sector (or Silicon Valley). My googlefu is not strong enough.
