Hey all, I am currently looking for a dataset for secondary analysis that I could hopefully use for my thesis. I recently decided (for reasons I won't go into) that I would like to focus on college students rather than High School students. I was planning on using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. Mainly what I am looking for is a data set like the YRBSS that includes assessment of individual mental-well being/Suicidal Behaviors. 

Ideally, I would also like for it to include data on place (rural/urban), race, sexual orientation, and if it includes substance abuse like the YRBSS that would be perfect. I have been struggling to find any dataset like this for college aged students. Mostly, I can only find psychological studies that use unrepresentative sampling methods. Thank you for any help anyone can give!
