Hi,

I am working on a project for which I would need a richly featured product dataset. Would it be possible to download the catalog of Amazon or Walmart for example? Including the pictures, product description, category and dimensions meta-data etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The closest I've found is the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce#olist_products_dataset.csv) on kaggle.

While there is weight and dimension information, the dataset seems to be more concerned with the product mix at an order level.

Specifically, the product description and photo is missing from the product dataset which is what I am interested in.
