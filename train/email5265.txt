I am currently doing a personal project where I am taking data from Billboard's website for their information on songs in the hot 100 weekly and posting it into a spreadsheet. The only problem with this is that the information can't be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet because it all filters into the same column. I am wondering if there is an existing dataset already out there that has the data on the hot 100 songs with song and artist by week for as many years as possible from 1958 (creation of hot 100) up. Anything would be extremely helpful because going through by hand has taken well over 50 hours and I only have about a years worth of information done.
