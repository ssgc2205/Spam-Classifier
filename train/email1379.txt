Hi, I'm looking for a Dutch text corpus, preferably with coherent paragraphs (not shuffled sentences). I could download/parse wikipedia but I have a hard time believing there isn't something out there already.

I did some googling of course but couldn't find anything readily available.

What I'm \*really\* looking for is a dataset of Dutch texts on rhyme, but at this point I'd be happy with any Dutch really.
