I'm BACK! I've uploaded hundreds of gigs of fanfic from [archiveofourown.org](https://archiveofourown.org), fictionpress, and [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net), along with a sqlite db of the metadata, for easy searching. Need a natural language corpus? there are probably better ones out there, but here's this one! in about a dozen different languages too!

&amp;#x200B;

enjoy.


EDIT: ao3continuing and updateable are compilations of datadumps I've had sitting around a while, ao3's are identical to the previous ones, with the addition of the newer dumps in one place.

I made these as one stop shops for those 2 website dumps in the future.
