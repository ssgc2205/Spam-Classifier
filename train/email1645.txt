Data scientists and enthusiasts of reddit, what is the best way to collect demographic data on the ongoing protests against police brutality and racial violence? Are you aware of any efforts that are already being made to record number of participants, demographic information, whether or not they have been arrested while protesting, etc? Would a mass survey be the best way?
