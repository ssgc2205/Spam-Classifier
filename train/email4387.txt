I'm trying to build something in Python to get good oportunities for flights from my city. I've been looking around for API's providing flight prices and it seems like currently there is no straightforward way to get this data - except doing scraping. The API from ITA Software (which was acquired by Google) would be exactly what I'm looking for, but it has been discontinued. There's also Skyscanner API, but it requires to ask for an API key, which is not certain I would be able to get. What's currently the best way to get this information for free?
