I wonder if there is a dataset which models the history of major corporations, including all the little mom-and-pop businesses or smaller companies they acquired along the way?

I'm suspecting not, other than trying to somehow infer it from investment sites with historic data (but this would only work for publicly traded companies anyway, which many were not).

I do find the 'family tree' of some corporations (Pepsico, Nestle, Activision, Kraft etc) really fascinating. Anything at all you know of, I'd love to see it, thanks
