Hi all,

The US Center for Disease Control has just published [a time series](https://data.cdc.gov/Policy-Surveillance/U-S-State-and-Territorial-Public-Mask-Mandates-Fro/62d6-pm5i) of mask mandates at the county level between April 2020 and January 2021. In total, 264 million Americans were subject to a mask mandate in January, equivalent to 80% of the population.
