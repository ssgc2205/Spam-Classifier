Hello!

I'm working on a college sustainability project related to the collection, consumption and disposal of oyster shells in the state of Massachusetts, USA. 

My group and I have been reaching out to restaurants and oyster shell producers in the area for rough estimates of their throughput, but would like some numerical data as well. 
We're aware that the Massachusetts DEP puts out a yearly report about shellfish, but the data we found there hasn't been to helpful.

Does anyone know a good dataset that might help?

Thanks!
