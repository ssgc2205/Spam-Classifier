Synesthesia. What is synesthesia? According to google, "Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense (for example, hearing) is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, color or flavor."

One of the types of synesthesia, one of the most common, is Grapheme-Colour synesthesia, where, as defined earlier, is where people associate things such as numbers, dates, letters, and many more, with colours. For instance, to me, the number five is a very bright orange, and the month of March is a deep green. This form is NOT only for people with synesthesia. You can submit to it whether you have synesthesia or not, just please submit to it seriously, with what you feel represents it best.  
Other things to note:  
\-Submitting for the months is mandatory, the weekdays and the numbers are not.  
\-The form will close on January 18   
\-My goal is 200 submissions. If anyone could somehow give this survey to others that would be greatly appreciated!
