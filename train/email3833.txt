I am experimenting in tensorflow with classifying how many persons are present in an image for a university project. Does anyone know of a dataset with images of groups of people with labels for how many there are?  
I suspect that there should exist such a dataset somewhere, but I cannot figure out what terms to search for to find it. Any help would be appreciated!
