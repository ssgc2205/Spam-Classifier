I am looking for sentiment data set with numeric sentiment strength. Most of the data sets I find are with positive, negative and neutral. 

Sentiment analyzer like Textblob and Vader does it. But I am getting very less accuracies with these, and am planning to train mine own. But finding data sets has become an issue.

Any pointers on other sentiment analyzers which work in this fashion also welcome. Stay safe!
