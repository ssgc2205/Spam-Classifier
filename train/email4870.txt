I am looking for census data by zip code. I can find all sorts of data sheets but they are all classified by some sort of class(age, income, sex, whatever). I just want total population by 5 digit zip code. Anyone have any thoughts on where to find it? I am employed by a rucking firm that delivers mail and it would be nice to have when looking at potential contracts.
