Hey Guys,  


Many tried and Failed, BE OUR HERO!

I am looking for someone who will help us scrape Crunchbase, we would need VC info together with all their portfolio companies. There is more than 40k VCs with average of 5-10 Startups funded. So the data set will be quite complex.

Are you interested in earning money for CB Scrape? Hit me up: [jkucera00@gmail.com](mailto:jkucera00@gmail.com)
