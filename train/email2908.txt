Iâ€™ve got an exciting idea for my capstone. Some friends and I are planning to renovate a garage and add an ADU. For the capstone, I would like to design a model which can predict building costs (materials, labor, permits, etc.).  
Iâ€™m looking for data but coming up short. Iâ€™ve looked through Kaggle with limited success. Also, Iâ€™ve found some papers on Google Scholar describing different techniques of estimating building costs, yet Iâ€™m having trouble getting ahold of any actual datasets ðŸ“·  
Do you have any ideas as to where I might search?  
Another exciting idea Iâ€™m considering is building a web scraper to collect the data. Any thoughts on this? Would it be too wide of a scope for the project?  
Not sure how to move forward exactly and any help would be great. Thanks!
