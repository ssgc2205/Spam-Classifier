Accepted to IEEE BigMM, this dataset contains JSON-Formatted Publicly-Available Metadata from Thingiverse, for both Users (n=283,873) and Designs (n=1,017,687). For qualitative analysis and for machine-learning applications, images associated with designs and multi-view panoramic 3D depth-map renders of 3D files are available for each design. For validation purposes, these panoramic renders are also provided for Shapenet, along with Matlab source code for generating these renders.

Please utilize the million+ images, 3D renders, and associated metadata to help with the retrieval, classification, and recommendation of printable designs! Read more and Download Here: [https://github.com/Alexander-Berman/ThingiPano](https://github.com/Alexander-Berman/ThingiPano)
