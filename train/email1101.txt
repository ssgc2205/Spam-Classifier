Hello,

I have acquired a large volume of anonymized transactional data during one of my projects.

The data includes:
  - transaction date
  - MCC Code
  - transaction type
  - transaction amount
  - POS
  - city/state/country
  - account balance
  - account type
  - card type (debit, credit)
  - anonymized customer ID
  - bank internal informations

The data doesn't display any personal information on customers and is only useful for modelling purposes.
I have also all the documentation that goes along.

Does anyone have an idea on how I could monetize this data ?
