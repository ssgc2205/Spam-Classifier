For example, given a list:

* www.google.com
* www.yahoo.com
* www.amazon.com

It would return:

* www.google.com - search
* www.yahoo.com - search
* www.amazon.com - ecommerce

That is, without actually visiting the site - so it would be an existing database. Most ones I've found actually visit the site, download the html and categorize the text. But I need basically a big list of urls and corresponding categories.
