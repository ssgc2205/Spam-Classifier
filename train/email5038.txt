Just need it to be 50+ observations with at least with at least 5 variables (at least 2 being categorical and at least 2 being quantitative). Maybe gender and race as the categorical variables? 

I'm new to this. It's my first applied stats project where I need to find my own data. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places? Any help would be great. Thanks!
