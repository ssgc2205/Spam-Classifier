Hi I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but I really need help finding data for a school project. I am trying to find a correlation between high school drop out rates and minor (below age of 18) employment rates. I have been looking for two days now and can’t seem to find any data on the information I’m looking for. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!
