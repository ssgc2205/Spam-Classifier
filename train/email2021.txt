I'm looking for a dataset that includes the amount of road mileage per United States county if it exists. I'm trying to make it myself using road shapefiles and county borders with the sf package in R, but I only have major roads, which don't cross every county, and it seems like the way I'm doing it is too computationally intense anyway. If anyone could help me out or suggest a solution, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
