I'm doing my master thesis right now, and I'm trying to find a dataset that shows celebrities (mostly concerned on Hollywood actors/actresses) usage of various social media (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook). If it can show the monthly amount of posts/followers/following they have for the years of 2015-2016, then it would fulfil the missing part of my research. Thank you!
