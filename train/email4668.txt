This is to inform software being written for open-source machines with linear motion functionality. The machines are novel in that they allow for arbitrary displacement over time, and are not locked into a specific stroke length. (Ie, both displacement and speed are variable during use.)

One company has analyzed NSFW videos to [determine motions seen during oral sex.](https://autoblow.com/bjpaper/) While this may be a promising approach to get some data, it's not ideal, both for the amount of labor involved and the accuracy of the data being collected.

This data may not exist anywhere, but figured I'd go fishing and see what might be out there.
