I'm looking for datasets which are short answers to a quiz like question in the sciences, which have been hand graded.  I'm aware of this dataset: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/downloads/ShortAnswerGrading_v1.0.tar.gz.  referenced in the paper: Text-to-text Semantic Similarity for Automatic Short Answer Grading, but I'm looking for others, hopefully with at least a few hundred answers.
