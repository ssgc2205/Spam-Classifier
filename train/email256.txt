One year's worth of salary data for most of Deloitte ended up getting released after the big Sony leak in 2014 (apparently an HR person moved from Deloitte to Sony and had the info on Sony's network somewhere).  I'd love to get my hands on it.

I've contacted the reporters that covered the leak in the story linked below, but I haven't received a response.

If any of you have the data saved, or know where it is archived, I'd be very grateful.  I've looked for months, but no dice.
