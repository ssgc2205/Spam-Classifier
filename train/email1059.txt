How can I do this? I have all the data in .txt files (I'm using a Wikipedia dump), and I would like to turn these texts into images that have a newspaper-like formatting: 

multiple columns, multiple different typefaces, some words bolded and others italicized. 

I would like to generate as many visual variations of a text that I can based on the above criteria.
