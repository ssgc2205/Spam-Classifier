Hello,

I’m looking for mobile ecommerce user interaction/activity data for a school project.
I’ve looked on Kaggle, GitHub and Google Cloud Platform but I couldn’t find any.

Can someone either tell me where can I find one or just give me more ideas of places where I can browse datasets so that I can find one?

Thank you in advance!
