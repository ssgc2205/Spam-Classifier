Hello

I am looking for datasets that contain information on nutrition &amp; food calories. However, I couldn't find one that includes food divided by calories.

e.g. Apple includes X calories. Almond milk from a company A includes Y calories. 

I found some websites, but not a comprehensive datasets.

Any help would be appreciated.
