Hi everyone, I have a stats project that asks us to find a data set and analyze it. I would like to conduct a 2x2x2 ANOVA to get more familiar with them. Can anyone help point me in the right direction? I have found a few websites, but nothing that has been any good. Don't really care about what the data is on, just that it is a 2x2x2 with a continuous DV. Thanks for the help in advance!
