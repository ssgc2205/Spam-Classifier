Hey Community. :) 
I’m not exactly sure if I’m right here, but if not it would be great if you could refer me to the right place. 

Anyways, I’m learning python and more specifically dictionaries ATM and I had the idea to compare the usage of vowels and characters in general across some different languages. 

Therefore I thought it would be cool, to compare these all by analyzing the same text (context wise) to get comparable results. And finally plot them in a bar graph. 
Do you know a good text I could use, that is accessible over a couple of languages for free? 
Thanks in advance. :)
