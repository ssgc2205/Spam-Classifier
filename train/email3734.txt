I've searched around but no success. Maybe it's not available for public to download? It is kind of weird that in the registry website, [https://www.nsopw.gov/en/Search/Results](https://www.nsopw.gov/en/Search/Results), we can search any area for all sex offenders nearby, but we can't download the whole database. Does anyone know why? Thanks a lot!
