I'm specifically interested in whether there's any large-scale or long-term data including variables about the search process itself (especially whether it was "open" or "closed") and any kind of outcomes. Actually, I can probably look up various outcomes from other university data; just having information about a lot of university president searches would be helpful. Any ideas?
