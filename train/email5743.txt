I am looking for a health survey of India on a individual granularity. The key parameters I am looking for are gender, location, job, age and health conditions. I haven't been able to find any good surveys for free which are recorded on an individual granularity. I'll be using the data to synthesise a much larger dataset by calculating its distribution. I need it it run covid simulations. I size of 10000+ would work, but larger the better. It'll be huge help if any of you know about such a dataset, and can share the resource here. Thank you!
