Hi all,

I'm currently trying to find agricultural statistics for Taiwan from 1911 until present, basically just the area sown and the production of four main crops (rice, wheat, maize and soybean). I‘m particularly interested in the period under Japanese (1911-1945) and Chiang Kai-shek rule (1945-1975).

I have looked at the statistical yearbook published by Taiwan Statistics Bureau and there is a lot of missing data prior to 2000. Statistical books such as *Economic Statistics of Mainland China*, 1949–1957 by Helen Yin and Yi-chang Yin turns out to contain only national data.

Please help! Any relevant info on any crops for any years will be appreciated! (I do have friends in TW so even older datasets that only have physical copies in a random TW library will be really helpful)

Thanks!
