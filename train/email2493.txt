Hi, I am currently writing my thesis in Economics on Mortality and Temperature. I handle data in R.

&amp;#x200B;

I need weekly temperature data from 2021-2000 on NUTS1 level (regional level).

&amp;#x200B;

DETAILS:

I have divided Europe in to regions (NUTS1 level) and found weekly mortality numbers for every region for every week from 2021W8 to 2020W1. That's about 1130 weeks and 100 regions. 

But, I have had trouble finding temperature data which was divided into these groups. I could boil down daily data but the only thing I have found is taken from 100.000 weather stations across Europe which is overwhelming.  


Daily data would work fine

&amp;#x200B;

thanks
