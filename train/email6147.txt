I just finished my first year in a data science graduate program. I got some good exposure to various algorithms and hands on experience with real data sets. Two areas that we didn't have time to devote individual assignments to are: 

\- (User-item) recommender systems 

\- Associate rules (like market basket analysis.) 

Any datasets out there that are good for exploring (either of) these ML techniques? 

I understand that there is likely no single dataset that would be applicable for both, but didn't want to create separate posts.
