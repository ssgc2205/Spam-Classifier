Hi! I work for a company that exports goods to various countries and it is about to get into the United States. In order to set the price of the goods we need to know the average prices of different types of food in different cities/states. Is there some kind of Statistical Association which published this data in the US? Of course I don't mind if the data is not free.
Thank you!
