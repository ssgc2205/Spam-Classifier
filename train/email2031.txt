[S3-Downlad](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/corepo/open_company_repository_v001.pgdump.sql.gz)

I needed a searchable table of companies but did not have the funding to pay for clearbit/fullcontact so i build [this business directory](http://corepo.org/) myself. If figure there are many other people who could use something like this in their project so please use it. And let me know if you find it useful so I can motivate myself to keep growing the index. There are 1.5 million companies described in the download. (After tonights data loads it will be 2 million and increasing every day ) . Its running postgres for search i use [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/pgtrgm.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/pgtrgm.html) with GIN index . Crazy fast full text substring search, would recommend.
