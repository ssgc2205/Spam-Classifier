I'm looking for any data about music, movie and software piracy. I know there exists datasets about pirated Oscar movies (http://waxy.org/2010/02/pirating_the_2010_oscars/) but I need more information (not only dates).

Basicly I am going to analyze the impact of piracy on the markets. I don't know yet how to estimate number of people downloading illegal stuff, but for a start any data would be useful.
