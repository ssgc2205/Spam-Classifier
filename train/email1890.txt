I'm going to be using this dataset to predict the success of a movie using the revenue and average rating as prediction values.

How should I clean this dataset? Ex: Should I make individual columns for each genre and mark them as binary values for each movie or take another approach? and much more tips like this would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance
