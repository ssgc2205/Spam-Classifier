Hello Reddit, 

I'm looking for 'natural' large graph datasets (hopefully labeled). By natural I mean datasets where graph is close-to-original structure (like karate graph or dolphins).

I want to avoid graph with adjacency matrix being similarity (or its approximation) matrix as I find those less 'natural' (sorry for that fuzzy term here) 

My final goal is to run clustering algorithms (spectral, local and others) so labels would be appreciated for further evaluation,

thanks
