Hello everyone, I am looking for data to research dynamic pricing for university, I have found data for Airbnb on [insiderairbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and a few datasets ([1](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/iowa-liquor-sales), [2](https://github.com/susanli2016/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/data/Sales_Product_Price_by_Store.csv), [3](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales)) for retail shops, other than that I have not been able to find anything else.

Most datasets that I have found or that I could create (using [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) for amazon products for example) only contain the price of the item across time, I also need the amount sold or ways to estimate it. My team and I are looking for data on the airline ticket, retail, and e-commerce industries. Any data, leads or ideas would be greatly appreciated!
