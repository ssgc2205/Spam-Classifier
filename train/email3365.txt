I want to have an up-to-date data set of the most popular songs in the US over the past few years.

Basically I want to find "trendy" lyrics, or phrases that are memorable and people recognize them. For example, a lot of people would recognize these phrases:

"shake it off"
"0 to 100 real quick"
"numa numa"
"under my umbrella"
"slim shady"
...
how do I find more?

I could go scrape billboard.com for the top songs every week over the last 10 years and go from there, but my web scraping skills are bad. Does anyone know a good way I can do this?
