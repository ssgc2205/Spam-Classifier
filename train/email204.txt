I'm searching for the 'most common' mortality tables for the United Kingdom, alternatively England.

The best results would be a table that might be used as the basis for the official government regulations in retirement planning, or life insurance/assurance.

Thanks much!

Edit:  I'm looking at the "National Life Tables" at this link.  If this is a 'standard' source, please confirm.
