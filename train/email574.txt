Hi all-

I'm on a bit of a fact-finding mission, and I'm looking for any dataset that pertains to carbon land credits or nutrient credits. Does not have to fit any specific parameters as the aim is to be used for an exercise. If anyone knows of any relevant rabbit holes to go down, that would me much appreciated!
