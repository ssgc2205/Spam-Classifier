 Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to invite you guys to participate in this academic research about "The Gamer Lifestyle". The questionnaire doesn't take any more than 6 minutes to be filled and you'll be asked to share your opinions and thoughts about the games you are playing at the moment. I wish I could count with your contribution as a player and as r/datasets  representative community. The link is down below.
