Hi all,

I'm looking for datasets that give estimates for how much the MSM covers on any given topic. (Terrorism, mass shootings, etc) and/or ones that give stats about events occur. 

I saw one particular visualization maybe one year ago that showed that "despite mass shootings and terrorism making up only a small percentage of US deaths, they get the majority of news coverage" if anyone can find that particular one, that'd be amazing!
