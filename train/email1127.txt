Hey, peeps! Are you tired of being a basic b*tch with no followers? Fear not, because I've got the ultimate guide to becoming a social media sensation! 

First off, you need to be posting non-stop. I'm talking at least 10 times a day. You don't want your followers to forget about you, do you? And don't worry if you have nothing interesting to say, just post a bunch of pointless pictures and memes. 

Next, you need to use as many hashtags as possible. Like seriously, cram as many as you can into your posts. Even if they have nothing to do
