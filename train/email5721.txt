Anyone know how to generate a dataset like [https://data.world/aurielle/inc-5000-2018](https://data.world/aurielle/inc-5000-2018)

But for the new 2019 list?

[https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2019/top-private-companies-2019-inc5000.html](https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2019/top-private-companies-2019-inc5000.html)

Looking to have the year of founding, website, instagram if available. How are these datasets like this usually generated?
