I'm interested in data on the religious composition of the military but haven't had any luck finding publicly available info. 

I've seen mention of the Religious Identification and Practices Survey (RIPS) and the Defense Manpower Data Center, but these don't seem to be available to the general public. 

Also it seems like this info should be easily accessible since religion goes on dog tags, right? I imagine I could get some of this info through a FOIA request, but that might take forever.
