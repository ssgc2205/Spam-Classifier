Does anyone know how to get airbnb/vrbo rental data for condos/housing within a certain zipcode? For example the time of year the property was booked for, nights it was booked, property data: sqft, bedrooms, beds, bathrooms, condo/townhome, etc. I'd like to run an analysis on whether it's financially advantageous to buy condos/townhomes/homes in certain parts of the country and like to see which is areas are most profitable for my situation. It'd also be really awesome to have HOA fees, taxes for the property, property value over the years. Went on Airbnb, but wasn't very successful. Anyone have any ideas on how to get my paws on some of this data? Thanks!
