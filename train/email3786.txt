I am working on the Red Rot classifier. It is a disease found in sugarcane. I have captured about 400 images of unhealthy sugarcane and 200 healthy ones. I plan to use augmentation on the images to get it up to 1000 total. But it would be better to find more images related to it. 

One more thing is that I don't know what ratio to use between healthy and unhealthy images. Any help would be appreciated.
