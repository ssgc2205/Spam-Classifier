The nonprofit (?) unhackthevote.org has been active on Twitter saying that they have statistical evidence strongly implying electoral fraud in the November 2016 US presidential election. They have an analysis ([here](http://www.votesleuth.org/)) showing their results. I've tweeted at the guy a couple of times, when he urges Twitter to help him stop electoral fraud, asking him for a full dataset, and so far he hasn't replied to that request directly, and certainly hasn't sent me any datasets.

I don't actually suspect anything fishy, here. I just want some basic transparency, and if this organization has found what it claims, I want to make awesome graphs about it and discuss it with colleagues and students. And probably tweet it, yeah.

Does anyone know if those data are available elsewhere? Or have you received a dataset from this organization? He might email me tomorrow and attach a file, but I'm hedging my bets because he seems to be dodging, probably for non-nefarious reasons like "I'm too busy," or "the dataset is messy."
