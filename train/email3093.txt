Hi, I located a dataset called "World Flora Online" that describes all the characteristics of all known plants in the world. This is EXACTLY what I need but I was disappointed to find that it doesn't seem to include pictures of each plant. Perhaps I'm wrong? Even so, I would presume that there would only be a single image and what I really need is a ImageNet like dataset where there are several hundred or preferably several thousand images for each plant for use in AI training.

Now in regards to trees and shrubs, I've yet to locate a equally comprehensive dataset that provides a flora describing all of the characteristics of each individual tree and shrubs that's currently known to exist. The closest thing I've been able to locate so far is a list of 60,000+ trees from the Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) but they do not advertise it as being a compilation of all known tree species so I'm presuming it's not and once again, I do not believe they provide any accompanying images since I was only able to locate a CSV document. As far as shrubs, I haven't been able to locate any sort of flora list or images at all.

What I need:

1. Extensive Image Dataset for All Known Plant Species with Hundreds of Images of Each Plant
2. A Complete Flora List of All Known Tree Species with Hundreds of Images of Each Tree as Well
3. A Complete Flora List and Image Dataset of All Known Shrubs

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you :)
