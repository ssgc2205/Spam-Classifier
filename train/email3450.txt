Anyone know of a way I can get an itemized form of what I spend at most retailers / grocery stores? I sat in on a seminar where the speaker works at a company that aggregates itemized purchase history by CC number and provides analytics around that to manufacturers and retailers. I would like to get that information for my personal purchases.
