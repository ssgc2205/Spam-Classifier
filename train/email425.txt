I miss baseball, but luckily there are lots of full games available to watch on YouTube and other third party sites. I want to watch games not *knowing* the outcome, so when the YouTube thumbnail says “WALKOFF BLAST!” right there, that’s a spoiler I wish I could avoid. But I also want to watch exciting high-scoring, competitive games, which I quantify by the number of runs and lead changes. “Trout 5-for-5 at Yankee Stadium” or whatever does not qualify as an exciting game in my book, and neither does “Sale with 15 Ks” or something like that. Even a game where a team is down for 8 innings then has a 9th inning comeback is not what I’m looking for, I just want lots of lead changes throughout. 

I’m not sure if my idea is even possible, but basically I would like to somehow create a data set, maybe in the form of a spreadsheet. Hopefully data is available be pulled from Baseball Reference or something, let's say from years 2016-2019. **This spreadsheet would rank games by number of total runs scored and total lead changes.** Record of teams does not matter. Time in the season does not matter. Outcome of the game does not matter, and ideally the spreadsheet would *hide* that information so I don’t know who the winner is before watching. 

This spreadsheet would provide me with a list of what I would consider the most fun games to watch, so I could just dial one up online and watch it like new! How would I go about setting something like this up? Is it even possible? Is there an even fancier data visualization we could use than just a spreadsheet? 

Thanks everybody!
