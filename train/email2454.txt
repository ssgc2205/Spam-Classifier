Hello everyone,  
I'm looking for publicly available datasets on industrial steam systems (basically the configuration, steam pressures, flowrates, temperatures together with their fuel and flue gas characteristics).

I've tried searching on Kaggle, OpenEI and US Deparment of Energy websites (among numerous others) without success.

Would anyone here know where a dataset of this type could be found please?
