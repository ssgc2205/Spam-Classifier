I am an unfortunate phd-student who recently discovered that my data for the final article of my dissertation were invalid, and we (my supervisors and I) are thus exploring potential matches between on the one hand, my competencies and research theme, and on the other, data that needs analysing.

My research focuses on external validity, so in my previous analyses, I have been focusing on the effect modification associated with independent variables. As an example, I have explored the differences in outcomes for patients suffering from COPD between three periods of time with diverging criteria for provision of a telemedicine service.

In exchange for letting me analyse your data, which I will, of course, use only for the explained purposes, I can offer you co-authorship (according to the Vancouver protocol, http://www.research.mq.edu.au/documents/policies/Vancouver.pdf) of an article along with the chance of having your research project assessed for external validity.

If you have a codebook available and know the number of observations in your dataset, I can elaborate a protocol for you to approve ahead of providing data.

Some of my previous publications can be found here:[PMID 25761469] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761469), [PMID 24828521] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828521), and [PMID 25011659] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011659)
- or by contacting me.
 
I am available for further information (I do not have much to do now that I don't have data) :(
