Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.

I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. All kinds of happy little splashes. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.
