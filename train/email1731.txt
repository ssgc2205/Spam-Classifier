Hey all,

I was working on a project where I needed to classify images of funduses of whether they have a disease or not and if they do, which specific one do they have. I wanted to know if you had any other datasets for me to test. It seems that Google did a similar project for diabetic retinopathy but they didn't make their dataset publicly available. Thank!
