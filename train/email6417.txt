Hi All,

Looking to purchase my first home over the next 12 months. Does anyone know where I could find a free data-set of property market data over the last 10 years or so that predominantly looks at property value growth over the period in Victoria, Australia? Hoping that this would show the growth on a suburb by suburb basis and differentiate between apartments, units, townhouses, and houses.

Cheers
