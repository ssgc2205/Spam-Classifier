I'm interested in analyzing some job listings data and last I heard Indeed.com had the highest traffic in that sector so it seems natural to start there. However, I haven't found any open source datasets for indeed data - which is surprising to me since I imagine many others are interested in this.

Have any of you here experienced hunting for Indeed.com data? Were you successful? or did you end up using an API or scraping your own?

[Their API](https://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/docs/job-search/) seems pretty limiting to me, so I was considering scraping the site for data. I wanted to ask some others their opinions before starting off on my own though.

Thanks for you time
