Hi. I'm working on my final project for this semester where we need to work on a data correlation dashboard and I'm interested in working on info related to internet media consumption (video games, porn, YouTube, etc) and analyze its correlation with COVID. Extra points if it's related to Latin America. Been looking around but haven't found anything useful with info from 2020. Any leads would help a lot. Thanks!
