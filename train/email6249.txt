Hi all,

I am currently learning regression analysis at school and was wondering how to apply it in some everyday situations such as the TF2 steam market economy.

This would probably use the same way you would make a regression model for a real life stock market economy so I was wondering:

\- Does anyone have any preexisting datasets on previous TF2 transactions on [backpack.tf](https://backpack.tf) or the steam market? 

\- If not, any pointers or resources for using Python Pandas to scrape such data from either website?

Thanks :)
