I'm looking for datasets related to mental health, ideally tweets (or other social media) where users self-reported their diagnoses (e.g. depression, ADHD, BPD, anxiety, PTSD etc.) or share that they attempted suicide, then including these users' tweet histories. That means I'm looking for datasets with users annotated with their mental illness.   
(Unfortunately, [the dataset I'd like to use](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/clpsych-2015-shared-task-evaluation/) is out of question as I was told it would be a bit exaggerative to involve the institute's ethics board for a student thesis.)
