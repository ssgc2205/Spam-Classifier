Looking to compare various mountain ranges and mountain data for a side project. I would like it to focus on mountaineering. but data just on the topography of the mountain ranges will be good too! I am looking for data on Mountain ranges that contain data on Min &amp; Max elevation, Temperature, Humidity, Time of year, successful summits, longitude and latitude, ect.. If you have any idea where I can find this information that will be helpful. Thank you!
