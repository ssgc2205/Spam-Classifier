Wondering if there is a database that allows people to upload videos of police violence (specifically the US) - obviously a lot of footage is currently uploaded to youtube/fb/instagram, however, this is clearly very easy to remove by those companies (and probably will be).

I have found [mappingpoliceviolence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) but I am thinking more of an open source reference site that anyone can upload/contribute to.

Thank you.  


EDIT: please look at  [https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality](https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality). This is an amazing page that is documenting/cataloging incidents of police brutality. There is also  [https://github.com/pb-files/pb-videos](https://github.com/pb-files/pb-videos) which is a backup of those videos (which generally come from twitter). There seems to be no automated back-up as far as I can see but please go contribute there if you have time!
