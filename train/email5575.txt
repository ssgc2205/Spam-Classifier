&gt;This dataset contains estimates of power generation and economic breakevens for solar-power projects at various scales and installation  costs in most communities in Canada.

It's a huge .csv file (170MB) and seems pretty detailed:

    The community's identification code in NRCan's Canadian Geographic Name Database
    Community name
    The type of community
    The province or territory the community is located in
    Latitude of the community
    Longitude of the community
    The closest latitude in the National Solar Radiation Database
    The closest longitude in the National Solar Radiation Database
    The type of array modeled
    A solar project that would help power a home (5 kW)
    A solar project that would help power a business (200 kW)
    A solar project that would help power a community (200 kW)
    A solar project whose panels are on fixed mounts and would sell power to the grid (50 MW)
    A solar project whose panels are on tracker mounts and would sell power to the grid (50 MW)
    How economic was modeled on an hourly basis, flat rate or time of use
    A fixed rate, which does not vary by time of day
    A changing rate that varies as demand rises and falls at different times of the day
    Whether provincial tariff costs are applied to utility-scale projects
    Tariff is applied
    Tariff is not applied
    The capacity of the project
    The amount of electricity generated in the project's first year
    The amount of electricity generated during the winter in the project's first year
    The amount of electricity generated during the spring in the project's first year
    The amount of electricity generated during the summer in the project's first year
    The amount of electricity generated during the fall in the project's first year
    The time period of the assumed installation costs, either now, the near future, or in a low-cost future
    The cost to install solar projects today
    The cost to install solar projects in the near future as costs fall a modest amount
    The cost to install solar projects in a low-cost future, where costs fall even more over the long term
    The solar project's breakeven price in dollars per megawatt-hour
    The $/MW.h cost of purchasing electricity from the grid in the case of residential, commercial, and community projects. The price at which electricity currently sells at for utility-scale projects
    The solar project's breakeven price in cents per kilowatt-hour
    The Â¢/kW.h cost of purchasing electricity from the grid in the case of residential, commercial, and community projects. The price at which electricity currently sells at for utility-scale projects
