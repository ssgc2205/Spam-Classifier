It's hard to know what's true or not lately, with people's agendas spurring sensational ideas through dangerous misinformation. I'm a senior computer engineering college student building a web app (small but running successfully) with a focus on statistical cognizance for the public, using engaging style and having no paywall.


I'm currently focused on locating good data sources—from economics, to science, to politics—and I'm wondering if y'all in this community would recommend any websites or specific pages in general; for example census.gov's economic census data over the years, which I may present with an emphasis on wealth inequality. Some general good tips for building a data app would be appreciated too!
