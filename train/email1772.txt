Hello! I've been searching for Census/ACS data that provides the median rent by number of bedrooms. I've been using the new [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov) site to find data for other variables I looking into as well, but the only dataset I've found for median rent by # of bedrooms does not go back beyond 2015. The earliest year I would need would be 2011. So, I'm wondering if y'all know whether the Bureau only started publishing those numbers in 2015 and afterwards! Any help would be much appreciated.
