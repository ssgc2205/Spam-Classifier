I have a bit over 2.5 million unlabeled memes that I've downloaded, which is around 170GB. I have no real use for them and I'd like to distribute them to anyone who wants them.

Since it's a chore to upload (and maybe difficult with my ISP's upload limits) I wanted to post here and see if there's interest. 

Definitely let me know what you'd do with them!
