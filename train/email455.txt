Is there a way to export [this data](https://realmpop.com/us.html) into plain text or excel tables?

I'm talking about the races/classes data, which you get access to by clicking the pie charts. 

I want to make graphs about the most and least common race and class combinations on all servers.

The job would be way easier if there was some way to quick copy-paste the pie chart data into text.

I tried inspeccing the element but no luck

People over at /r/dataisbeautiful told me I might get some help with a scraper here
