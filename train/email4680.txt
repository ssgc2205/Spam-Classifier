Greetings,

I am trying to use the dataset below for a course project, but they do not mention the type of wave frequency in the dataset:

[https://physionet.org/content/auditory-eeg/1.0.0/](https://physionet.org/content/auditory-eeg/1.0.0/)

They do mention that they are using " 1st order 1-40 Hz Butterworth filter and a 50 Hz notch filter with a quality factor of 30 ," but I am not sure if that means anything in terms of brainwave type. Can someone help me out?
