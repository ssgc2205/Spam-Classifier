Hi all.

I want to do some analysis on the EV market - essentially looking to prove that teslas claim on market domination is overblown.

Does anyone know of any datasets i could leverage?

Looking for at a minimum:
Sales of electric vehicles (unit volumes or $)
Brand
Year

Ideally global but happy to settle on whats available.

Cheers!
