I'm looking for additional datasets for my research in the signal (time series) classification in biomedical domain.

So far I've focused on two papers, concerning classification of activity signal for depression or schizophrenia detection:

\- Depresjon: [link](https://datasets.simula.no/depresjon/) \- time series classification for depression detection

\- Psykose: [link](https://datasets.simula.no/psykose/) \- time series classification for schizophrenia detection

I'm looking for additional datasets to provide additional baselines for my paper. They just need to be time series data (not necessarily typical signal data like activity measurements) from biomedical domain.
