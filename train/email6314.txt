Hey I'm looking to do some analysis for my dissertation and I need some advice. I'm building a database to analyse UFC PPV sales and the main determinants of the figures. After doing some reading, I want to include a personal rivalry variable - I know its hard to measure, but in the UFC fights seem to be binary personal or not personal - is there a way I can do this more quickly than finding the build up for each and every fight? thanks
