I am designing for my math class a Performance Task for the Trigonometry unit.  I want to give them authentic data of Damped Harmonic Motion (ideally, one of spring, pendulum, swing), and have them come up with functions (exponential combined with trigonometric) to fit the data.  I have spent hours searching around on the Internet but could not find such a dataset.  Could someone help?  Thanks.
