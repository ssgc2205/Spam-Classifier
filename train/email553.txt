I’m looking for year by year population statistics for US states before 1977. Current Pop Survey does this to a degree, but doesn’t have data for Alaska before ‘77. 

I’m just looking for proportions of each state for age, race, gender. I’m happy to work with microdata and aggregate it if anyone know of CPS-type stuff.
