I recently saw Hans Rosling's Tedtalk presentation "The best stats you've ever seen" and now I am motivated to create something similar for my college project. I am supposed to use Python's Bokeh library to create an interactive (drill up/down-able) visual.

Any pointers would help a great deal.  
Thank you.
