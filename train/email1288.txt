Hi all,

I've been searching for a while on my own to now avail - was wondering if anybody had all the PERSONAL/CAMPAIGN (not official) Twitter accounts for the current remembers of the US Congress and Senate? I am trying to do some social listening analysis for US politics but official Twitter accounts are often toned down to the point where it is hindering sentiment analysis.

Thank you all in advance!
