I used this census tract shape file from [NYU](https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu-2451-34505) but there is a lot of census tracts that i am missing. For example, i have some census tracts that i need to map in my data, Im using the NYU shapefile to map them. But the shapefile dont have about 86 of the census tracts that i have. **I either need to use 2010 census tract data and then use 2010 census shapefiles or use my current 2019 census data and fidn a 2019 shapefile**

Here is a list of  census Tracts i have on my data but isnt in the shapafile, Im thinking that the shape file is too old? But census is every 10 years so idk?
