Iâ€™m looking for data sets showing rent prices over time for Major cities in the US.

My goal is to generate graphs showing rent trends.

Ideally it would be an API I can just query and get what I need from on demand, but if its a giant bundle I am happy to parse that out and build my own DB.

Where can I find data related to this?
