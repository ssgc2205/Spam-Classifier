I am working on a senior project optimizing transportation of oil/oil equivalent from oil exporting countries to oil importing countries, as well as some other processes in the supply chain. Does anyone know where you can find data outlining the cost to transport barrels of oil/oil equivalent via pipeline, sea, or over land by country or region? Or even just links to websites with these figures (sorry for not specifically being a dataSET request, but I figured this would be the best place to ask!)
