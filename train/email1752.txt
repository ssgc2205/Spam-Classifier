Hey everyone,

I am experiencing quite a difficult time finding a dataset containing information about university graduate courses in Computer Science. The most important information regards the acceptance rates (which is not a must, since this is often not publicly available) and tuition fees.

Information from Times Higher Education and other such ranking does, unfortunately, not provide enough information to answer questions about this.

Thank you in advance!
