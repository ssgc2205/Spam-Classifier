Hi, I'm a cofounder at [workaround.online](https://workaround.online). We just built an [open-source video/image annotation tool](https://github.com/WorkAroundOnline/traininghub-annotate) and we'd like to release a public dataset w/ videos and annotated images to demonstrate our capabilities for potential clients.

I happen to bike commute to work every day, so I thought it would be fun to do a bike commuting dataset [(here's a sample trip)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/6vcseQknJgPNm6vu8). I was wondering what annotations would be useful over this kind of video- or if anyone had an idea for a dataset we could provide labels/annotations for.
