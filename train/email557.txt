Hey, everyone.

I'm working on an infographic and I need a reliable source/s that would contain information about the average temperature in every continent over the period of the last 100 years (at least). It could be by year or by decade.

I'll really appreciate any help I can get as I need specific data for this project and can't seem to find any source on the internet that would include all the info I need.

Many thanks!
