I'm trying to model certain wellness factors (life expectancy, health factors like obesity and preventable diseases, graduation rates, etc.) per state vs the state and local taxes paid on average. I'm testing the hypothesis that higher taxes in the US corresponds to a better quality of life. I'd also like to test this against taxation globally but for now I just want to focus on the US. Any idea where I can get the taxation data (state and local)  for a span of time - let's say 10 years? Educational data specific to graduation rates would also be helpful. I've found health related data before and I think I can locate that again. But the tax and education data will be really helpful. Also any insight, advice and criticism for what I'm trying to do will be hugely appreciated.
