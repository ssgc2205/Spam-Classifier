Hi, I'm losing my mind trying to find this, I'm making an invoicing program for a friend of mine and I'm looking to add a list of truck manufacturers and models (for a drop-down menu). I went as far as calling the Ministry of Transportation in Canada but they don't have anything like that. Any help would be great. Thanks!
