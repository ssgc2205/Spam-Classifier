I have excel spreadsheet with a bunch of data. I am going to import it into a DB to try to get rid of the crap I dont need and do some analysis.

What I would really like to do is to display the locations and be able to adjust by date. I know I can put the locations on Google maps, but it will be all the locations at once.

The data covers 24 months. I'd like to see how the locations change and maybe where the sudden the spike of activity has come from recently.

Any suggestions on how to best visually display the data and be able to adjust the dates?
