Does anyone know where I can find a robust Pokémon dataset that includes Gen8? 
I would also be satisfied with a dataset that included Gen 1-7. 


I recently finished a Tableau Bootcamp and want to have some fun with all the great stuff I learned. 


If anyone is interested, I can share my dashboard and visualizations on this sub after it’s all said and done. 


Has anyone here ever manipulated Pokémon data in the past? What were some of the questions you were looking to answer? Were you satisfied with the results? 


Did you use any cool visualization techniques or dashboard tricks? 


Thanks!!!
