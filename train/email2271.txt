Hi r/datasets,

CEO of DoltHub (https://www.dolthub.com) here. We are running a contest on DoltHub to gather and clean US Presidential Election precinct-level results. The prize pool is $25,000. The prize will be divided up in February based on number of cells added to the database, last edit of a single cell wins.

This kind of contest is possible because Dolt (https://www.doltdb.com) is a database with Git-style version control. It's the only SQL database you can branch and merge allowing hundreds of people to collaboratively edit.

For more information and some hints about how to get started, check out:

We're looking forward to this community's contributions.
