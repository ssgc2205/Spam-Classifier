I'm looking for a dataset that includes a survey question asking respondents about the specific news outlets and/or social media they use. Ideally, it would be an open ended question where respondents can list all the websites they use (getting more than just the major news outlets and websites). Does anyone know of a dataset that may include this? I've been looking around, but have not found anything too close to that yet.
